INT. LOG LADY’S CABIN - DAY

MUSIC: CALL OF THE BLACK LODGE     272K

As she speaks directly to us, the ‘LOG LADY’ MARGARET LANTERMEN holds her wooden log in her arms like a baby.

LOG LADY
My husband died in a fire. No one can know my sorrow. My love is gone. Yet, I feel him near me. Sometimes I can almost see him. At night when the wind blows, I think of what he might have been. Again I wonder: why? When I see a fire, I feel my anger rising. This was not a friendly fire. This was not a forest fire. It was a fire in the woods. This is all I am permitted to say.

CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP EXPLOSION - NIGHT

The assembled triangle object EXPLODES into a ROARING wall of fire.




DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WHITE LODGE - DAY

The wall of fire FADES OUT as the next scene FADES IN. Surrounded by the lush vegetation of a forest paradise, MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS, wearing his military uniform, sits on a stone carved throne that is partially covered with vines. We SLOWLY ZOOM IN on the face of MAJOR BRIGGS.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I remember stepping from the flames, a vague shape in the dark, then nothing. Till I found myself standing by the cold remains of our campfire, two days later.

DR. HAYWARD (OFF SCREEN)
(distorted speech) Major, there are some new techniques that might help us break through your amnesia.

MAJOR BRIGGS
My memories are immune from regression uh ... I can feel them: palatable, the smells, the sensation. Everything is known to me yet somehow beyond my reach.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
(distorted speech) Do you remember anything else?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Very little, save for one disturbing image of ... a giant owl, vervasive.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
A giant owl?

SOUND EFFECT: LION ROAR




WHITE OUT TO: CLOSE-UP OWL

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of an inversed image of an owl as it flaps its wings.




WHITE OUT TO: CLOSE-UP SCAR

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP on the flash of a Polaroid camera as it activates.




CUT TO:

INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

SOUND EFFECT: MUSICAL SHRIEK   8K

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP on the face of MAJOR BRIGGS. We ZOOM OUT.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
A giant owl? How big?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Enough to cloud my mind and memory.

MAJOR BRIGGS, wearing his military uniform, is seated at the end of the long conference table with his hat lying on the table before him. With a chalk sketch of the map of the town of Twin Peaks as a backdrop on a blackboard, MAJOR BRIGGS nervously twiddles with his hands and stares off into the distance as he attempts to recall his incident. DALE COOPER, wearing a flannel shirt and khakis, stands to the left of MAJOR BRIGGS and DR. WILL HAYWARD, holding a Polaroid camera and a developing photograph, stands to the right of MAJOR BRIGGS. DR. HAYWARD walks over to COOPER and hands him the photograph.

DR. HAYWARD
Three triangular scars behind the right ear in perfect proportion.

DR. HAYWARD places the camera down on the corner of the table. COOPER puts the photograph on the table. Next to COOPER, SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN sits on the edge of the tabletop.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Major Briggs, exactly what does your work involve?

COOPER sits down at the table and leans over crossed arms to MAJOR BRIGGS.

MAJOR BRIGGS
That information ... as I’ve repeated innocently to myself, classified. Keeping secrets ... means less meaningful to me now.

MAJOR BRIGGS becomes more animated as he speaks with his hands.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Perhaps there are sources of information that’s no longer important, that can transcend the need to conspire. Information of such weight that pertains not ...

MAJOR BRIGGS trembles, touches the tabletop using the index and pinky fingers on his left hand and looks at COOPER.

MAJOR BRIGGS
... oh god ... is this meant for the soul ... my soul?

Puzzled, TRUMAN stares at MAJOR BRIGGS. COOPER looks down at the table in contemplation. Still trembling slightly, MAJOR BRIGGS rubs his hands together.

COOPER
Major, perhaps you better start back at the beginning?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Are you familiar with project Blue Book?

COOPER
Yes sir I am, the Air Force investigation into the phenomena of unidentified flying objects.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Officially it disbanded in 1969, but there are those of us who ... continue an unofficial capacity, examining the heavens as before. In the case of Twin Peaks the Earth below.

MAJOR BRIGGS gestures downward with his left hand. COOPER and TRUMAN look at each other, exchanging awareness from the information revealed by MAJOR BRIGGS.

MAJOR BRIGGS
We are searching for a place called the white lodge ...

MAJOR BRIGGS stops short of his thought as the door to conference room opens. MAJOR BRIGGS sits quietly and upright as two military policemen, M.P. #1 and M.P. #2, walk into the room.

M.P. #1
Major Briggs.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I’ve been expecting you.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Now hold on just a minute fellows.

SHERIFF TRUMAN stands up, walks up to MAJOR BRIGGS and stands between him and the M.P.'S.

M.P. #1
Colonel Reilly’s orders.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I don’t care what orders you got this is my station and Major Briggs happens to be a friend of mine ...

As a friendly gesture, SHERIFF TRUMAN rests a hand on MAJOR BRIGGS left shoulder. MAJOR BRIGGS pats TRUMAN'S wrist for restraint.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Harry.

COOPER and MAJOR BRIGGS stand up.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I’m afraid we’ll will have to continue this discussion at a later date.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Are you sure you want to go with them?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Yeah, goodbye.

MAJOR BRIGGS pats TRUMAN'S left arm and then walks out of the room with the two M.P.'S. DR. HAYWARD and SHERIFF TRUMAN watch MAJOR BRIGGS leave. COOPER turns to the photograph lying on the table. TRUMAN and DR. HAYWARD turn toward the table and quietly look at each other before they turn their attention to COOPER as he picks up the photograph.


COOPER'S POV:

Through COOPER'S POV we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of a Polaroid photograph taken of MAJOR BRIGGS' neck. Behind the ear is a reddish-brown scar of three triangles joined at one point, similar to the emblem for a radiation hazard.

Drops of water fall onto the photograph.


CLOSE ON: COOPER'S FACE

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of COOPER'S face as he looks up from the photograph and towards the ceiling.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP FIRE SPRINKLER

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of a fire sprinkler on the ceiling as drops of water slowly leak and fall from sprinkler.


BACK TO SCENE:

We FOCUS on a WIDE SHOT of the interior of the conference room. Peering upward at the fire sprinkler, COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DR. HAYWARD all quietly move their heads to look at each other. COOPER returns his attention to the photograph and wipes the water drops off. Mystified, TRUMAN and DR. HAYWARD look at each other once more before they too look back at the photograph.

SOUND EFFECT: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING   4K


INSERT: CLOSE-UP FIRE SPRINKLER

We FOCUS on a tight CLOSE-UP of the fire sprinkler on the ceiling as water leaks out and drips off.

CUT TO:

INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of a telephone perched on the edge of TRUMAN'S desk next to a plate laden with donuts. We ZOOM OUT. Sitting in a chair facing the phone, ERNIE NILES nervously reaches out for the phone but quickly pulls back. Standing by the window behind ERNIE, DEA AGENT DENISE BRYSON keeps an eye on ERNIE while using a finger nail file.

DENISE
Oh go ahead Ernie. It won’t bite.

ERNIE
A lot you know pal. These men are dangerous thugs. Not that I haven’t met plenty of their kind before. Jean Renault is a hard man but I’ve known men that would make him quiver.

From behind, DENISE walks up to ERNIE and pats his shoulders.

DENISE
Ernie, come on, make the call.

DENISE cradles ERNIE'S neck with a right hand. Annoyed, ERNIE wiggles out of DENISE'S grasp.

The door to SHERIFF TRUMAN'S office opens and COOPER pokes his head inside. Holding a cup of coffee, COOPER asks ...

COOPER
Well, have we set the buy yet?

DENISE
Trying to. Ernie’s a wee bit gun shy.

ERNIE
Gun shy! Ernie Nile’s is as bold as can be, let me at him.

ERNIE boldly picks up the receiver and punches the buttons with his index finger as he dials the phone number. COOPER steps into the room and closes the door behind himself. ERNIE cups the mouth of the receiver and cowers ...

ERNIE
Please, don’t make do this. This is suicide I know please I’m begging you please for everybody’s sake please.

COOPER
Ernie - Ernie - Ernie.

COOPER walks up to the desk next to ERNIE, lifts the plate of donuts up and takes a seat on the desktop where the plate of donuts was resting. COOPER picks up a donut from the top of the stack and is alarmed at the sight of a bite taken out of it. Holding the donut, COOPER glares at ERNIE.

ERNIE
Hello. (reply) May I speak to Jean Renault please.

COOPER puts the bitten donut back on the plate, grabs another donut and takes a bite. Still standing behind ERNIE, DENISE runs a hand through ERNIE'S hair. Irked, ERNIE flinches and squirms in his chair.

ERNIE
Hi Jean, yeah I’ve got that big out of town buy here.

With his mouth full, COOPER grins and gives ERNIE a big thumbs up sign.

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - DAY

Seated in her reception office, LUCY MORAN reads through the personal section of the newspaper. LUCY briefly looks up as she sees DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN walk into the building.

ANDY
Hi Lucy.

ANDY walks by LUCY'S reception window. As ANDY walks around the corner to his left he nearly bumps into RICHARD ‘DICK’ TREMAYNE. Dressed in an overcoat, DICK holds an index finger at his lips as a sign to be quiet and gestures to ANDY to follow him. DICK pulls the collar of his coat up to disguise himself as he walks past the reception office door. DICK leads ANDY into the locker room and closes the door for privacy.

MUSIC: AUDREY’S DANCE

DICK
(agitated whisper) Where have you been Andrew?

ANDY
There was a cat in a tree.

DICK
Police officer’s (rolls his eyes) work is never done. Fortunately for us my efforts have bore more palatable fruit. I paid the Happy Helping Hand Adoption Agency a visit where several blue haired ladies were only too happy to sup from my open palm. Unfortunately, Little Nicky’s records have been sealed and returned to the orphanage.

ANDY
We’ll never know what really happened to Little Nicky’s parents.

DICK
Oh courage Andrew, do not despair dear boy. Next stop, that self said orphanage and Little Nicky’s records within.


CLOSE ON: LUCY

We FOCUS on LUCY seated in her reception office. LUCY overhears.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(muffled) Maybe we should tell Lucy.

DICK (OFF SCREEN)
(muffled) Absolutely not.


BACK TO SCENE:

We FOCUS on DICK and ANDY through the glass window of the closed door to the locker room.

DICK
Listen dear boy, this is strictly a man’s job. Ready?

DICK points the way out with a gesture using his gloves. ANDY and DICK walk off.

LUCY scampers out of her reception office and looks into the empty locker room through the glass window in the door. LUCY looks into the reception area and meets COOPER as he walks up to her.

COOPER
Lucy.

LUCY
Hi.

COOPER signals to LUCY to come near as he bends down to fetch himself a cup of water from the water fountain.

COOPER
Any luck?

LUCY
I checked the personals columns and every national newspaper on the list and I didn’t see anything that looked like a chess deal or find any mention of the name Windom Earle. I’m sorry.

COOPER nods his head.

COOPER
That’s okay.

COOPER walks off and LUCY returns to her reception office.

BIG ED looks at his cup of coffee.

We need to talk

The scene at the diner FADES OUT as the next scene FADES IN. In the incomplete kitchen of the house, BOBBY BRIGGS paces around the kitchen table drinking a beer. LEO JOHNSON, in a vegetable state with his head slumped to one side, sits in wheel chair next to the table as SHELLY JOHNSON, wearing an apron over a purple sweater, feeds him pudding. The television is on and the television program Invitation to Love can be heard in the background.

SHELLY

BOBBY
I had practice.

SHELLY
Football season is over.

SHELLY slams the dishrag on top of the table. BOBBY looks up from his newspaper and over to SHELLY.

BOBBY
Baseball, our national pastime.

SHELLY removes her apron and throws it on top of the table. She picks up the dishrag and continues to wipe pudding off of herself.

SHELLY
Fine, you can clean when you get back.

BOBBY stands up and walks away from the table.

BOBBY
I ain’t coming back.

SHELLY
What?

SHELLY tosses the dishrag to the table and walks over to BOBBY.

BOBBY
You’re looking at Ben Horne’s brand new boy.

BOBBY puts on his black suit jacket.

BOBBY
Do the words golden opportunity mean anything to you? This is my big break Shelly, you think I’ve got anything better to do then to give Leo Johnson a bubble bath?

SHELLY points to herself.

SHELLY
Well what about me Bobby?

SHELLY holds her arms out.

SHELLY
Do I not have anything better to do?

BOBBY
Not that I can think of.

SHELLY winds up and slaps BOBBY across the face. Solidly composed, BOBBY touches his left cheek and then quietly walks off towards the front door of the house.

CHET (OFF SCREEN)
(television) Get real.

SHELLY
Bobby.

CHET (OFF SCREEN)

JAMES
Yeah its me.

Wearing sunglasses, EVELYN MARSH quietly glides through the open split door of the garage and leans against one of the closed doors as she listens in on JAMES'S telephone conversation.

BIG ED
(over the phone) Where are you? You alright?

JAMES
Oh I’m okay. Uh look I need a favor. Uhm I need you to get all the money out of my savings account.

Long distance?

JAMES
Twin Peaks.

EVELYN
You homesick James?

JAMES
(straight up) No.

EVELYN
Tell me about Twin Peaks.

JAMES
There’s nothing to say.

EVELYN walks up to JAMES.

EVELYN
You could start with why you left. Its a woman as I recall. No you said it was a few of them.

JAMES
I loved a girl who died. Her name was Laura. I thought I knew her but I didn’t. I guess nobody did.

EVELYN
I’m sorry.

JAMES
My life used to make sense, you know. I didn’t like it all the time but it ... was mine, and I felt like it belonged to me. And then, and then Laura died ... and my life belonged to something else, to Laura.

JAMES walks away from EVELYN.

JAMES
And no matter what I did, no matter how much I tried to help, another girl got murdered. And I just wanted to get on my bike and ride away, take off and just go as far from Twin Peaks as the day will take me.

EVELYN walks up to JAMES. JAMES turns to face her.

EVELYN
I know the feeling James.

EVELYN holds JAMES'S chin.

EVELYN
I know the feeling.

JAMES cocks his head to the side and they kiss each other. JAMES runs his hand through her hair and then removes her wide rim sunglasses to reveal a bruised eye.

JAMES
(gently) Why do you let him hurt you?

EVELYN silences JAMES with a kiss.

A car can be heard pulling up outside the garage. EVELYN quickly turns her head to look outside.

EVELYN
Jeffrey’s leaving, (turns to JAMES) I need you. Will you help me?

MALCOLM SLOAN can be heard outside of the garage.

MUSIC: YOUNG NADINE’S THEME     35K

Reading a newspaper with a cup of coffee before him, MIKE NELSON, wearing his red and white Twin Peaks high school letterman jacket, sits alone at the island counter. NADINE HURLEY, dressed in a red and white Twin Peaks high school cheerleader outfit, walks up to MIKE.

NADINE
Good morning Mike Nelson.

NADINE takes a seat next to MIKE at the counter. MIKE turns to NADINE, becomes agitated and then quickly turns back.

MIKE
Oh lord.

MIKE tosses his paper aside and rubs his forehead in frustration.

NADINE
You wanna share a soda? How about a nice, big piece of cherry pie, two forks?

MIKE
Mrs. Hurley, Nadine I want my own piece of cherry pie. In fact, I want two pieces of cherry pie by myself.

NADINE
Okay.

NADINE stares longingly at MIKE. MIKE reaches out for his cup of coffee but stops short as NADINE blurts out ...

NADINE
Meatloaf?

MIKE faces NADINE and speaks with his hands as he retorts ...

MIKE
No, cherry pie and coffee. In fact, I want sixteen cups of coffee. I don’t want to talk with you, I don’t want to walk with you, I don’t want to see you, I don’t want to know you. Is that clear enough to understand? Or do I need a court order to get my point across.

Heavyhearted, NADINE looks down at the island counter.

NADINE
Mike Nelson, you are the handsomest boy I’ve ever known, (looks up at MIKE) and I would really like it if you and I could go out on a date.

Surprised, MIKE slumps back in his chair. NADINE reaches out with both hands, clasps MIKE'S head and kisses him. As NADINE continues to kiss MIKE she attracts the attention of some of the diners in the restaurant as she pushes him back until he is lying down on the next seat.

NADINE
I’m sorry, sometimes I can’t help myself.

NADINE lifts herself off of MIKE. MIKE grasps the island countertop to help lift himself up. Flustered and enthralled, MIKE looks around the diner.

We FOCUS on NORMA as she walks out of the kitchen and puts on a blue overcoat as she enters the island counter service area. Through a gap between the large and tall appliances on the center island service area, HANK JENNINGS, standing on the other side of the island counter service area, spots NORMA and asks ...

In the kitchen, JOSIE PACKARD, wearing a maid's uniform, opens one of the swinging double doors that separates the foyer from the kitchen and walks up to the front door. As JOSIE opens the front door and spots TRUMAN she instantly retreats back into the kitchen. SHERIFF TRUMAN marches inside and follows JOSIE into the kitchen. JOSIE stands beside a chopping block at the kitchen island counter where she was chopping vegetables. TRUMAN walks up to JOSIE, removes his hat and demands ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Now you’re moving into my place.

JOSIE
I’m sorry.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What happened? What the hell ya’ doing here?

JOSIE
This is my home.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Home? After everything Catherine’s done to you.

JOSIE

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Josie.

TRUMAN touches JOSIE'S arm. He cradles JOSIE'S neck with his right hand and moves behind her.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Josie.

TRUMAN kisses the back of her neck and runs his hand on her neck and down but JOSIE grabs his hand, holds it and then moves it aside.

JOSIE
Oh go home.

Standing behind her, TRUMAN swings an arm over JOSIE'S shoulder, brushes her body and cradles her close as he kisses her neck.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Josie, let me take care of you.

JOSIE
No.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Please.

JOSIE
Listen, I’m safe here ... and when I’m here you’re safe too.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
No.

TRUMAN releases his grip, spins JOSIE around to face him and cradles her jaw with his hands. They look into each other's eyes and then kiss.

JOSIE touches TRUMAN'S jaw and pushes him away.

JOSIE
(gently) Stop.

JOSIE pushes TRUMAN'S hands away from their embrace on her jaw.

JOSIE
Look at me, I’m Catherine’s maid. I’m no good for you.

TRUMAN reaches out and clasps his hands around JOSIE'S neck and jaw.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You are good for me. I love you.

With desire in their eyes, TRUMAN bends his head down and kisses JOSIE.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I want you.

TRUMAN brushes kisses on JOSIE'S lips as he slowly pushes her forward and up against a kitchen wall. As their passion grows, JOSIE runs her hands over his back and then cradles her arms around his neck. After a long and intense smooch, TRUMAN looks deeply into JOSIE'S eyes and then, as he holds her close, kisses her on her forehead. TRUMAN then returns to stroke kisses across JOSIE'S lips.

HAWK throws his hands out to the ground to toss off the sweat on his hands. ERNIE towels himself off while HAWK grabs for some more white tape.

ERNIE
Oh thanks a lot, huh. That’s nervous perspiration man, hyperhydrosus, a childhood condition. I didn’t notice it until the war, Korea, remember that theater. I was leading a battalion towards the 49th parallel. We were just a bunch of fresh faced kids, I didn’t know what kind of hell we were stepping into.

COOPER stops pacing and restrains ERNIE.

In the hallway, MALCOLM sneaks up EVELYN as she slowly and quietly closes the door. EVELYN is spooked as she turns around and sees MALCOLM next to her.

MALCOLM
How’s our baby boy?

Standing beside EVELYN, MALCOLM brushes his hand through her hair and on her chin.

EVELYN
Sound asleep, and dreaming of love.

MALCOLM and EVELYN embrace and kiss.

MALCOLM
Lucky - lucky - lucky - lucky boy.

MALCOLM kisses EVELYN'S temple.

MALCOLM
Lucky - lucky - lucky ...

Resting her head on MALCOLM'S shoulder in their embrace, EVELYN frowns unsure of her actions towards JAMES.

PRESTON’S POV:

Through PRESTON’S POV we get a view outside through the window and see a row of police cruisers with their red and blue siren lights flashing. A number of DEPUTIES hide behind the cars with handguns, shotguns and rifles pointed toward the house.

PRESTON
More deputies.


BACK TO SCENE:

We FOCUS on PRESTON, holding a handgun, as he kneels on the ground and peers out of the front window. To the right of the window is the front door to the house.

PRESTON
Sharp shooters.

PRESTON sits down on the ground at the left corner of the room and looks up at JEAN.

PRESTON
Lets deal and lets run.

JEAN lays against the edge of a wall that divides the kitchen from the hallway.

JEAN
Will they let us run Agent Cooper?

COOPER sits on the floor between the front door and JEAN. COOPER has a bruised cut near his left eye.

COOPER
No.

JEAN
So you think they - they will deal?

JEAN looks over to PRESTON.

COOPER
No.

JEAN loosely holds a gun pointed at COOPER.

JEAN
What you suggest we do?

COOPER
Surrender.

JEAN
Okay.

Sitting on the floor peering out the window, PRESTON turns to JEAN.

PRESTON
Are you crazy?

JEAN
No, but first we - we must decide to give up quietly or (looks at COOPER) to kill him.

COOPER
Then we both die.

JEAN
I know.

COOPER
Is my death so important to you?

JEAN
My two brothers die. I hold you responsible.

COOPER
Why?

JEAN
(questioning glare) Why?

JEAN squats down beside COOPER.

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME (PIANO SOLO)

JEAN
Before you came here, Twin Peak was a simple place. My brothers deal dope to the teenagers and the truck drivers. One-Eyed Jack welcome the businessman and the tourist. Quiet people live a quiet life. Then a pretty girl die and you arrive and everything change.

MUSIC ENDS: LAURA PALMER’S THEME (PIANO SOLO)

PRESTON nervously looks out of the window. COOPER intently listens to JEAN.

JEAN
My brother Bernardo shot and left to die in the ... the woods. A grieving father smother my remaining brother with a ... a pillow. Kidnapping, dead. Suddenly the quiet people they’re quiet no more. Suddenly the ... the simple dream become the nightmare. So, if you die maybe you will be the last to die. Maybe you brought the ... the nightmare with you and maybe the nightmare will die with you.

COOPER and JEAN glance up to PRESTON.

PRESTON
I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about, but I do know we’ve got a damn problem here. And if you’re not going to solve it I will.

PRESTON looks out the window.


PRESTON'S POV:

From PRESTON'S POV out the window, we FOCUS on a WAITRESS holding a tray of food as she slowly walks towards the house.


BACK TO SCENE:

We FOCUS on PRESTON near the window.

PRESTON
Jean.

JEAN
What?

PRESTON
Take a look at this. Did you order any food?

MUSIC: WALKING IN THE DARK     32K

JEAN
No.

JEAN walks towards the center of the kitchen and looks outside through the glass window in the door. With his revolver ready, PRESTON stands up and moves to the door. JEAN holds a hand up to calm PRESTON.

JEAN
No - no - no, let her come.

COOPER realizes the ploy.

JEAN
Let her come, its just a girl.



CUT TO:

EXT. DEAD DOG FARM - NIGHT

DEPUTY ANDY rushes beside SHERIFF TRUMAN behind the open door of the police cruiser. ANDY, TRUMAN and other DEPUTIES stand prepared with their guns, rifles and shotguns aimed towards the house.

The WAITRESS carrying a tray of food towards the house is AGENT DENNIS as DENISE in disguise wearing one of the short waitress uniforms from the Double-R Diner.




CUT TO:

INT. DEAD DOG FARM - NIGHT

PRESTON opens the door.

JEAN
Hello.

Holding a tray of food, DENISE walks inside with a smile.

DENISE
Suppertime.

COOPER recognizes DENISE and waits for the scheme to engage.

JEAN
Yes.

DENISE passes the tray of food to JEAN. As JEAN holds the tray of food in both hands before himself, DENISE reaches down and slowly lifts the uniform skirt above the left knee to show the top of black stockings.

PRESTON stands unaware. JEAN smiles as he looks at DENISE'S leg. JEAN looks up and begins to study DENISE'S face.

JEAN
Don’t I know ... you?


COOPER'S POV

From COOPER'S POV facing the back of DENISE, DENISE stands close by and as DENISE'S skirt rises a handgun is revealed tucked into the top of the black stocking. COOPER quickly reaches out and grabs the handgun.


BACK TO SCENE:

DENISE punches PRESTON and drives him back and to the floor.

COOPER hops back to a corner of the room near the door and aims the handgun at JEAN. With his hands occupied holding a tray of food, JEAN'S eyes widen in horror. COOPER fires the handgun twice directly at JEAN'S chest. JEAN drops the tray of food and rushes to his right to stumble into the hallway.




CUT TO:

EXT. DEAD DOG FARM - NIGHT

Leading the way, SHERIFF TRUMAN and several DEPUTIES run toward the house.




CUT TO:

INT. DEAD DOG FARM - NIGHT

DENISE picks PRESTON up and slams him against the wall.

COOPER stands up and directs his gun towards the hallway. With blood dripping from his mouth, JEAN slowly pokes his head through the kitchen entrance from the hallway. JEAN falls to his knees as he tries to position himself to return fire at COOPER. With his last breath, JEAN tries to reach for his gun in its shoulder harness under his suit jacket. COOPER calmly keeps his gun aimed at JEAN. JEAN wavers and falls to the ground dead.

DENISE cracks PRESTON across the jaw with two hard right punches.

SHERIFF TRUMAN leaps through the open front door and falls to one knee with his revolver drawn ready. With his gun drawn, DEPUTY ANDY rushes through the open door and falls to one knee beside TRUMAN. Having entered from the back of the house, DEPUTY HAWK stands over the body of JEAN as he holds a firing position into the kitchen.

DENISE holds PRESTON, vanquished, against a wall. Relieved, COOPER stands on one knee next to SHERIFF TRUMAN. TRUMAN turns to COOPER and asks ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You okay?

COOPER
(nods yes) Yeah. Great thinking Denise.

DENISE
(smiles, jokes) It was just my legs. Thank Sheriff Truman it was his idea.

ANDY, TRUMAN and COOPER stand up. COOPER looks at TRUMAN.

COOPER
Harry S. Truman.

From SHELLY'S POV, the lights dim and the music slows to a drawl as the power supply is disrupted. We look around the room. The lights glow brightly and the music plays smoothly. The shadow outline of LEO'S lifting harness, near LEO'S bed, sways slightly behind a hospital curtain wall divider. Once again the lights dim and the music gradually slows to almost shut off but returns back on.


BACK TO SCENE:

SHELLY stands up and walks towards LEO'S bed. The lights and music dim to nearly turn off before returning to normal.


SHELLY'S POV:

From SHELLY'S POV, we walk past the hospital curtain wall divider. LEO is not in bed but in his place is a toy clown doll laying on the pillow and is moving! LEO'S lifting harness sways slightly.


BACK TO SCENE:

Spooked, SHELLY calls out ...

SHELLY
Bobby this isn’t funny.


SHELLY'S POV:

From SHELLY'S POV, we FOCUS on the toy clown doll as its arms move and a ball rotates on its nose. We moves away from LEO'S bed and back into the living room.

SHELLY

SHELLY spins the wheelchair around to face her and whips off the blanket lying on the back of the chair. The wheelchair is unoccupied! SHELLY freezes as she looks across the table. Standing with his back to the wall with his face covered with cake frosting and wearing a party cone hat, LEO sinisterly says ...

LEO

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

DEPUTY COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN and LUCY walk up to the second set of double doors to the building.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
A bomb? What do you mean bomb? Start at the beginning Lucy.

COOPER stops right at the door and peers inside the dark interior through the glass window in the door. COOPER turns around and listens to LUCY as she recalls the incident to TRUMAN.

LUCY
Well the voice on the phone said there was a bomb planted in the woods.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah.

DEPUTY HAWK walks by them and enters the dark interior of the building.

LUCY
Now it didn’t say which woods, and all of a sudden there was this huge explosion and all the lights went out. So then I called the fire department.

COOPER
Good work Lucy.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Was there a fire?

LUCY
Two of them: first there was one at the fire station but most of the fire ...

HAWK returns and interrupts LUCY as he hands out flashlights to everyone and remarks ...

HAWK
I’m going to check on the generator, ...

HAWK shakes head side-to-side.

HAWK
... something's not right.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Okay. (to LUCY) So?

HAWK walks back inside the building. COOPER peers through the window in the door.

LUCY
We’re playing bingo and I’m trying to get everybody together then ...

COOPER turns to LUCY.

COOPER
Excuse me Lucy.

COOPER walks inside to the reception area.

LUCY
... there was the big explosion I told you about.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Alright.

LUCY
It sounded like it was right up stairs, so we all got out of here.

Standing near the second set of double doors to the building, we FOCUS on COOPER as he scans the dark interior. Though muffled, LUCY and SHERIFF TRUMAN can still be heard. COOPER reaches inside his coat pocket and removes a cigarette lighter.

LUCY
Well it turned out to be a transformer up a pole, right behind and above the building. Well we had to wait before we could come back inside ...

COOPER walks into the reception room, lights up the cigarette lighter and holds it up to view the interior.

LUCY
... because it was shooting sparks everywhere and we were afraid that the station was going to catch on fire too, but it didn’t.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Did any one else see it?

Using the lighter to light his way, COOPER walks past the open door to SHERIFF TRUMAN'S office.

LUCY
Suspicious in nature, that’s what Chief Kimball said. He was suffering from smoke inhalation at the time so he sounded a little horse.

COOPER looks around TRUMAN'S office.

LUCY
You should hear his cough. I’m going to make him some chicken soup.

COOPER'S eyes widen as he focus on something in the room.

We FOCUS on LUCY and SHERIFF TRUMAN standing at the entrance. Through the glass window in the door at the entrance and the open door to TRUMAN'S office, COOPER can be seen standing inside TRUMAN'S office.

COOPER
Harry!

TRUMAN opens the door and calls out ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah Coop!

COOPER
You better take a look at this, alone.

TRUMAN turns to LUCY.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy, wait here.

TRUMAN walks inside to the reception area.

Good lord.


COOPER'S POV:

From COOPER'S POV, we FOCUS on the object that caught COOPER'S attention. Seated at TRUMAN'S desk is a longhaired DEAD MAN gagged and wearing a dirty jean jacket and eyeglasses. The DEAD MAN is pointing at a square on a chessboard on top of TRUMAN'S desk. TRUMAN'S mounted deer head trophy is lying on its side on top of TRUMAN'S desk to the right of the DEAD MAN.

SHERIFF TRUMAN (OFF SCREEN)
Who is it?


BACK TO SCENE:

Wide eyed, COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN stare at the DEAD MAN. We ZOOM IN on COOPER'S face.

COOPER
I don’t know. Its a chess game. Windom Earle’s next move.
