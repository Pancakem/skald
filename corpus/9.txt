INT. LOG LADY’S CABIN - DAY

MUSIC: CALL OF THE BLACK LODGE     272K

As she speaks directly to us, the ‘LOG LADY’ MARGARET LANTERMEN holds her wooden log in her arms like a baby. The LOG LADY sits with her back to the fireplace of her cabin and beside a table.

LOG LADY
Hello again. Can you see through a wall? Can you see through human skin? X-rays see through solid, or so-called solid objects. There are things in life that exist, and yet our eyes cannot see them. Have you ever seen something startling that others cannot see? Why are some things kept from our vision? Is life a puzzle? I am filled with questions. Sometimes my questions are answered. In my heart, I can tell if the answer is correct. I am my own judge. In a dream, are all the characters really you? Different aspects of you? Do answers come in dreams? One more thing: I grew up in the woods. I understand many things because of the woods. Trees standing together, growing alongside one another, providing so much. I chew pitch gum. On the outside, let’s say of the ponderosa pine, sometimes pitch oozes out. Runny pitch is no good to chew. Hard, brittle pitch is no good. But in between there exists a firm, slightly crusted pitch with such a flavor. This is the pitch I chew.

CUT TO:

INT. DALE COOPER’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

On the floor near the foot of the bed, FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER, dressed in a tuxedo but without the jacket, is sprawled out face up. Bleeding from his abdomen, COOPER lays motionless with his eyes closed.

DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN’S voice can be heard from the telephone.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Agent Cooper? Can you hear me? Its Andy.

INSERT: CLOSE-UP PHONE

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME    

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the phone with the receiver laying beside it.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Agent Cooper, its Andy.

BACK TO SCENE:

We FOCUS on AGENT COOPER laying on the floor. COOPER’S white dress shirt has two other bullet holes from which no blood emerges.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Can you hear me? Agent Cooper?

MUSIC ENDS: LAURA PALMER’S THEME    

We FOCUS on the open doorway to COOPER’s room. A tall and thin man, an OLD WAITER, slowly walks into view carrying a tray with a glass of warm milk that COOPER had ordered. The OLD WAITER walks into the doorway and stops.

OLD WAITER
Room service.

CLOSE ON: COOPER’S FACE

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of AGENT COOPER’S face. With his eyes closed, COOPER’S eyes squirm and his lips move.


BACK TO SCENE:

Slowly the OLD WAITER, still holding the tray, walks up to COOPER. Standing beside him, the OLD WAITER bends slightly as he peers down at COOPER.

OLD WAITER
How ya’ doin’ down there?

COOPER moves his head slightly and cracks his eyes open to a small slit.

OLD WAITER
(smiling) Warm milk.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Agent Cooper?

COOPER
Would you put it on the table please. And would you call a doctor.

OLD WAITER
Sure.

The OLD WAITER slowly walks over to the telephone. The OLD WAITER puts the tray with the glass of milk down beside the phone. Annoyed, the OLD WAITER sternly looks at the phone as he hears ANDY constantly calling out.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Are you all right? Can you hear me? Agent Cooper? Agent Cooper? Agent Cooper?

INSERT: CLOSE-UP PHONE

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the telephone receiver.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Its Andy, can you hear me? Are you all right? Agent Cooper?

BACK TO SCENE:

Annoyed by the phone, the OLD WAITER shakes his head slightly. The OLD WAITER picks up the receiver and tries to hang up the phone by putting the receiver in its cradle.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Are you all right? Agent Cooper?

The OLD WAITER puts the receiver in the cradle crooked so it won’t hang up properly.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(from the phone) Agent Cooper? Agent Cooper? Its Andy. Its An ...

Fiddling with the receiver, the OLD WAITER pushes the receiver down until it contacts one of the switches that disconnects the call. The OLD WAITER slowly turns in place and bends over slightly to COOPER.

OLD WAITER
I hung it up for ya’.

COOPER slowly turns his head toward the OLD WAITER and opens his eyes slightly.

COOPER
What’s that?

OLD WAITER
Hung it up for ya’.

COOPER
Did you call the doctor?

The OLD WAITER gives COOPER a confused look.

COOPER
The doctor?

OLD WAITER
(confused) Uhhhh. Its hung up, the phone.

COOPER
Thank you.

OLD WAITER
Sure. No problem.

The OLD WAITER turns around and grabs a pen and a small pad of paper, the bill. The OLD WAITER turns back around, bends down and holds out the pen and the bill towards COOPER. COOPER raises his left hand and grabs the pen.

COOPER
Does this include a gratuity?

OLD WAITER
(smiles) Yes sir.

COOPER signs the tab.

OLD WAITER
Thank you. Thank you kindly.

The OLD WAITER straightens up. The OLD WAITER turns to look at the tray and then turns back to COOPER.

OLD WAITER
The milk will get cool on you. Pretty soon.

COOPER
Okay.

Smiling, the OLD WAITER slowly heads toward the door.

The OLD WAITER stops and turns to COOPER.

OLD WAITER
I’ve heard about you.

COOPER moves his head and opens his eyes slightly to look at the OLD WAITER. The OLD WAITER gives COOPER a thumbs up handsign. COOPER produces a tiny grin. The OLD WAITER winks at COOPER. Smiling, the OLD WAITER turns back to the door, slowly heads out of the room and out of view down the hallway.

COOPER looks at the ceiling.

A moment later the OLD WAITER returns and steps back inside the room.

OLD WAITER
(smiling) I’ve heard about you.

COOPER moves his head to look at the OLD WAITER. Again, the OLD WAITER gives COOPER a thumbs up handsign. COOPER slowly moves his left hand up and gives the OLD WAITER a thumbs up handsign also. Smiling, the OLD WAITER turns around, leaves the room and moves out of sight down the hallway.

Once again, the OLD WAITER returns to stand in the doorway. The OLD WAITER winks and flashes a thumbs up handsign. COOPER slowly lifts his left hand and waves at the OLD WAITER with his index finger. The OLD WAITER nods, winks, turns and walks off down the hall out of sight.

COOPER lays motionless on the floor. Suddenly, a RINGING can be heard.

SOUND EFFECT: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING   20K

A ghostly apparition of a GIANT man walks into the room and stands beside COOPER. The GIANT loses his ghostly form and appears solid. The room becomes dark. A bright spotlight falls on COOPER and the GIANT.

GIANT
I will tell you three things.

COOPER’S eyes open slightly.

GIANT
If I tell them to you and they come true, then will you believe me?

COOPER
Who’s that?

GIANT
Think of me as a friend.

COOPER
Where do you come from?

The GIANT shakes his head gently from side-to-side.

GIANT
The question is, where have you gone? The first thing I will tell you is, there’s a man ... in a smiling bag.

COOPER
(repeats) Man in a smiling bag.

GIANT
Second thing is, the owls are not what they seem. Third thing is, without chemicals ... he points.

COOPER
What do these things mean?

GIANT
This is all I am permitted to say. Give me your ring. I will return it to you when you find these things to be true.

The GIANT bends down. COOPER raises his left hand. The GIANT grips COOPER’S hand and slowly removes his ring from COOPER’S pinkie finger.

GIANT
We want to help you.

COOPER
Who’s we?

GIANT
One last thing. Leo locked inside hungry horse. There’s a clue at Leo’s house.

The GIANT looks at COOPER’S bullet wound.

GIANT
You will require medical attention.

COOPER gently nods his head for yes. The GIANT returns into a ghostly apparition and disappears. The RINGING sound stops and the lights in the room return to normal.

SOUND EFFECT ENDS: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING   20K

COOPER remains motionless on the floor.

A little frightened, BLACKIE backs up in her chair.

JERRY
Who’s holding out on who?

BLACKIE
Please.

JERRY takes a seat in front of BLACKIE’S desk.

JERRY
Oh Blackie.

JERRY tilts the lamp shade of the lamp sitting on BLACKIE’S desk to shine light onto BLACKIE’S face. BLACKIE cringes slightly. JERRY looks BLACKIE over.

JERRY
You used to be so pretty. Blackie, Blackie.

JERRY reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a tiny bag of heroin. JERRY kisses the tiny bag, extends it towards BLACKIE and drops it on the desk.

Holding the seam of the bed curtains, AUDREY listens.

BENJAMIN slowly walks to the bed.

AUDREY turns her head to look at the wall the bed is up against. AUDREY lets go of the curtain seam and grabs a white mask that is hanging on the wall.

BENJAMIN jerks the bed curtains open.

BENJAMIN
GOTCHA!

BEN laughs. AUDREY is hiding under the bedspread with only her legs showing.

BENJAMIN
I will huff ... and puff ...

BEN yanks the bedspread away.

BENJAMIN
... and blow your house down.

AUDREY has her face covered with the white mask. AUDREY slowly sits up and moves to a corner of bed away from her father. BEN reaches out to try to remove the mask.

BENJAMIN
Oh my - my. Aren’t you a sweet thing. Mmm. I gotta see you. I must see you.

AUDREY slaps at BEN’S hands.

AUDREY
Go away. I’m shy.

BENJAMIN
Didn’t they tell you who I was?

AUDREY
Yeah - mm-hmm.

BENJAMIN
That’s right.

There is a KNOCK at the door.

JERRY (OFF SCREEN)
Ben, its Jerr. We got a situation.

BENJAMIN
So have I.

JERRY (OFF SCREEN)
Brother Ben, we got a S - N - A - G.

BENJAMIN
Blast, I do have a situation.

JERRY KNOCKS on the door again.

JERRY (OFF SCREEN)
Come on Ben.

BENJAMIN
Coming Jerr. (to PRUDENCE/AUDREY) I like you.

AUDREY pulls the bed spread to cover her legs.

BENJAMIN
You know how to interest a man. That’s half the battle. Next time we will play a different game. I will make the rules. You’ll like it.

BEN walks around to the other side of the bed. AUDREY moves to puts some distance between herself and BEN.

BENJAMIN
Fun game. Everybody wins.

BENJAMIN looks PRUDENCE/AUDREY over one last time and leaves. BEN straightens his suit and tie before he exits the room.

MUSIC ENDS: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (2:12 - 2:31)

AUDREY moves to the corner of the bed nearest the door. AUDREY lowers the mask from her face, holds onto the bed post and pushes the red drapes aside. AUDREY is on the verge of crying as she ponders what she has witnessed.

CUT TO:

INT. DALE COOPER’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Sprawled out on the floor, AGENT COOPER open his eyes slightly.

COOPER
Diane, my recorder is on the table. I’m unable to reach it at this time. I can only hope that I inadvertently pressed the voice activation button.

INSERT: CLOSE-UP TAPE RECORDER

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of COOPER’S mini tape recorder. The mini tape recorder is on and recording.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
I’m lying on the floor of my room. I’ve been shot.

BACK TO SCENE:

COOPER
There’s a great deal of pain and a fair amount of blood. Fortunately I was wearing my bullet proof vest last night per bureau regulations when working undercover. I remember folding the vest up trying to chase down a wood tick. If you can imagine the impact on your chest of three bowling balls dropped from the height of about nine feet, you might began to approximate the sensation. All things considered, being shot is not as bad as I always thought it might be. As long as you can keep the fear from your mind. But I guess you can say that about almost anything in life. Its not so bad as long as you can keep the fear from your mind.

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:10)

SOUND EFFECT: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING   20K

COOPER moves his hands and his head to view his ring finger. COOPER sees that his ring is missing.

MUSIC ENDS: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:10)

COOPER
At a time like this, curiously, you began to think of the things you regret or the things you might miss. I would like in general to treat people with much more care and respect. I would like to climb a tall hill. Not too tall. Sit in the cool grass. Not too cool. And feel the sun on my face. I wished I could have cracked the Lindburg kidnapping case. I would very much like to make love to a beautiful woman who I had genuine affection for. And of course, it goes without saying, that I would like to visit Tibet. I wish they could get their country back and the Dalai Lama could return. Oh I would like that very much. All in all, a very interesting experience.

At the open doorway, DEPUTY TOMMY ‘THE HAWK’ HILL, SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN and DEPUTY ANDY lurch into firing positions with their guns drawn and scan the room.

COOPER
Ahh, they’re here.

Leo Johnson was shot. Jacques Renault was strangled. The mill burned. Shelly and Pete got smoke inhalation. Catherine and Josie are missing. Nadine is in a coma from taking sleeping pills.

Perplexed, COOPER slowly turns his head to look at DR. HAYWARD.

COOPER
How long have I been out?

DR. HAYWARD
Its 7:45 in the morning. We haven’t had this much action in one night since the Elk’s Club fire of ’59.

COOPER slowly turns his head back to TRUMAN.

COOPER
Harry, we need to get a search warrant for Leo Johnson’s house.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
No need. Leo was shot in his own living room.

LUCY
Deputy Brennan found him.

DR. HAYWARD and SHERIFF TRUMAN look at LUCY because of her tone of voice. COOPER, in obvious pain, slowly sits himself up. DR. HAYWARD places a hand on COOPER’S right shoulder to try to stop him.

DR. HAYWARD
You’re not going anywhere.

COOPER raises his right hand.

COOPER
Doc, when the will is invoked, the recuperative powers of the physical body are simply extraordinary.

COOPER slowly nudges himself off the examining table.

DONNA
Thanks.

MADELEINE puts her prescription eyeglasses on.

MADELEINE
Donna, do you see these glasses that I’m wearing?

DONNA
Yeah.

MADELEINE removes her eyeglasses and bends them at the nose bridge, breaking them.

MADELEINE
I hate them. I’m never wearing these again.

DONNA grabs herself a cigarette.

DONNA
Okay.

MADELEINE
Is it true about James?

Using a lighter, DONNA lights her cigarette.

DONNA
He spent the night in jail.

MADELEINE
Do you think its because of what we did?

DONNA
Look, we don’t know if we did anything. My dad said Jacoby got sick because he was attacked. All we did was send him a tape.

MADELEINE
Maybe he wouldn’t have been attacked if we hadn’t.

DONNA
Maybe, maybe the sun won’t come up tomorrow if you wash your hair. Think like that and you’re going to go crazy. What’s done is done. The only way this won’t come back to haunt us is if we keep quiet about what happened last night. I can assure you James is doing the same thing.

DONNA takes a drag from her cigarette.

DONNA
Get the picture.

MADELEINE

MADELEINE changes her expression and her eyes widen.

MADELEINE
Uncle Leland’s hair ... turned white.

ALBERT
How simple can I make it Cooper. FBI agent gets shot, FBI agent investigates. I’m in proximity working the Seattle lab. I’m familiar with the underlying case.

Working around his rib cage, ALBERT touches a sensitive spot. COOPER GRUNTS in pain.

MUSIC ENDS: ANDY’S THEME   49K

ALBERT
Does that hurt?

COOPER
Yes. Albert the point is you’re not going to win any local popularity contests.

ALBERT
No, the point is Gordon Cole ordered me back here.

ALBERT puts a stethoscope, that’s been hanging around his neck, to his ears and applies the probe to COOPER chest.

ALBERT
Breathe.

Slowly and with some pain, COOPER takes a deep breath.

ALBERT
Again.

COOPER complies and takes another breath.

ALBERT
Okay.

ALBERT removes his stethoscope and places it on top of his metal suitcase.

ALBERT
You were shot by a right handed person, five foot six to five foot ten inches tall at a distances of less then three feet. I’ll have ballistics later this afternoon. You’re still blank on the other details?

COOPER
Yes.

ALBERT
What was your vest doing riding up like that?

COOPER
Wood tick.

ALBERT looks away and exhales heavily.

ALBERT
Meanwhile one of your principle suspects is killed in his hospital bed and the other is shot in his living room. You tell me, vigilantly justice or just clean country living?

COOPER
Albert, where does this attitude of general unpleasantness come from?

ALBERT
I’ll have to get back to you on that.

COOPER
Well if you don’t want two black eyes on a regular basis I suggest you make some kind of peace with rural life.

ALBERT
(smartass) Great. After the square dance maybe we can all take a hayride.

There is a KNOCK at the door.

COOPER
Come in.

DEPUTY ANDY enters the room, closes the door behind himself and walks up to COOPER.

COOPER
Andy, how’s the nose?

ANDY
(smiling) Not a mark on it, only blood squirted out.

ALBERT

COOPER quickly turns to glare at ALBERT.

COOPER

ANDY
Agent Cooper, guess what, I have the answer to the riddle that you told me this morning. I called Hungry Horse Montana. The word locked, Leo Johnson was locked in a jail in Hungry Horse Montana.

COOPER
When Andy?

ANDY searches his shirt pockets, his front pants pockets and then his back pants pockets where he finds his notepad. ANDY flips through a few pages of the pad and then reads outloud:

ANDY
February nine, 1988.

COOPER and ALBERT looks at each other and simultaneously say:

COOPER and ALBERT
Teresa Banks.

COOPER
Looks like Leo has an alibi for the night Teresa Banks was murdered. Good work Andy.

ANDY smiles brightly. ALBERT looks at ANDY.

ALBERT
(smartass) Yeah, woof.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
A red corvette, Leo Johnson.

COOPER holds his hand out.

JAMES
How?

JAMES stands up and digs into his pant’s pocket to get the necklace.

JAMES
Well this was in Jacoby’s office.

JAMES hands the necklace to COOPER. SHERIFF TRUMAN stands up.

JAMES
It was in a coconut.

COOPER moves a little closer to JAMES to verify his response.

COOPER
A coconut?

COOPER quickly looks at TRUMAN then moves to look at HAWK.

COOPER
Hawk take James back to his cell.

HAWK complies. JAMES leaves the room with HAWK right behind him.

COOPER
Jacoby?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
How did you know he had the necklace?

COOPER
Laura and James were in love. I figured he had to have the other half of the necklace but if he had the other half of the necklace he would have given it to us to help with the case. Then it dawned on me. Something or someone frightened him off. He had to have it so I asked him for it.

COOPER shakes his head.

COOPER
Jacoby? I didn’t figure he had anything to do with this at all.

I smoke every once in a while. Helps me relieve tension.

I didn’t tell them about you or Mady.

DONNA

She’s fine. She hasn’t said anything either.

DONNA takes one last drag on her cigarette then flicks it away to a corner of the cell block.

Nothin’s wrong.

Clasping the bars of the cell DONNA leans back.

Or is it just not okay for me to want you. Get out soon James.

DONNA moves closer to JAMES and puts her mouth around the knuckle of his index finger that is loosely clasped around one of the iron bars of the jail cell.

BOBBY
Fat chance. I won’t let him hurt us any more. Are you alright?

Doctors seem to think so.

BOBBY
You know Shelly, hospitals are dangerous places. First of all, they're crawling with sick people. And second of all, that food can kill you.

SHELLY and BOBBY chuckle.

I saw this coming. I didn’t want to believe it. What’s worse is I’m sitting here thinking that maybe that there’s a part of me that ... didn’t want to stop her. And that’s a full load.

COOPER
When did you get married Ed?

ALBERT, after having just taken a drink and finding it distasteful, looks into his coffee cup and then to SHERIFF TRUMAN. TRUMAN is pouring himself a cup of coffee.

BIG ED
Right out of high school. Norma and I had been together about four years. Everybody figured we get hitched. That be that. I barely knew Nadine to say hello to.

ALBERT puts his cup of coffee aside, unable to drink it.

BIG ED
That spring, one bad weekend, Norma ran off with Hank. I was so twisted up inside I couldn’t see straight. When I opened my eyes there was Nadine right in front of me. There was something so sweet, so helpless about her. We drove all night. Ended up in some little town in Montana, out past Great Falls, and I asked her to marry me; half jokin’, half drunk, half crazy. It was light before we found the justice of the peace. Norma, well she hadn’t even slept with Hank. The look on her face when she found out. Nadine and I, we went up to my dad’s old cabin up in Eagle Pass. Honeymoon. I was hoping maybe we’d get to talking about a divorce, annulment, something.

SHERIFF TRUMAN listens on but ALBERT is obviously bored with the story.

BIG ED
But Nadine was so happy. And you know by golly ... I shot out Nadine’s eye on that honeymoon.

ALBERT’S eyes brighten up with interest.

COOPER
What do you mean Ed?

BIG ED
Well the first day we were hunting pheasant. Nadine’s a crack shot and we already had a couple of birds. And I felt good shooting. Listening to the sound echoing, roll down those hills. I fired and ... a piece of buckshot skipped off a rock and caught Nadine square in the eye.

COOPER
Man, that’s a tough one.

BIG ED
She laid across my lap as we drove back to town.

ALBERT starts to silently laugh. SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at ALBERT. ALBERT tries to compose himself.

BIG ED
She never cried. She never blamed me. She never hated me for it.

COOPER sternfully looks at ALBERT. ALBERT pulls out a hankerchief for the tears the laughing has produced in his eyes.

BIG ED
Couple of months later Norma married Hank. So I don’t believe in fate. You make your bed, you sleep in it.

ALBERT
Sorry.

ALBERT folds up his hankerchief. DEPUTY HAWK walks into the corridor with JAMES.

HAWK
Ed, someone here to see you.

BIG ED and COOPER stand up. COOPER moves to the side as BIG ED and JAMES hug in grief for NADINE. AGENT COOPER walks away from the group.

COOPER slowly turns his head to look down another corridor. COOPER’S eyes widen. COOPER walks down the corridor and up to an open doorway.

COOPER

AGENT COOPER’S POV:

Through COOPER’S POV we view a black body bag grasped at the ceiling by two hooks that hold the ends of the bag. The bag sags in the middle producing, what looks like, a smile.

COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN and ALBERT walk up the corridor.

COOPER
Poor Ed. Poor Nadine.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah.

ALBERT
(smiling) Yeah.

COOPER
Albert why don’t you take this opportunity to check in at the Great Northern.

COOPER, ALBERT and TRUMAN walk off. In the distant hallway, a DOCTOR walks up to a nurse’s station.

DOCTOR
Nurse, I really mean it, you better speak to that kitchen.

PETE MARTELL, wearing a hospital gown, sits back in a hospital bed with an oxygen breathing tube at his nose. A cart with a food tray with bins of green and yellowish goo is positioned before him. PETE moves himself to sit up, leans to the tray and sniffs the air above the goo. Unable to smell anything, PETE removes the oxygen breathing tube from his nose, moves closer to the goo and takes a big whiff.

PETE
Ughhh!

PETE is immediately repulsed and gags for air. PETE quickly repositions the oxygen tube to his nose and breathes deeply.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Rocks and bottles?

COOPER
Chalk and blackboard will be just fine.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Jelly donuts?

COOPER
Harry, that goes without saying.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN walk off.

We FOCUS on an open doorway as NORMA backs out of SHELLY’S hospital room. NORMA stands in the doorway as she speaks to SHELLY.

NORMA

SHELLY
Norma I’m serious. Bring the whole pie.

NORMA thinks it over.

NORMA

SHELLY
Okay.

SHELLY brandishes a buoyant grin.

NORMA
You better sleep.

SHELLY

NORMA

NORMA closes the door to SHELLY’S room and walks off down the hall. We FAVOR ON NORMA as she walks down the hall and approaches the room where NADINE is being taken care of. The door to NADINE’S room is open and NORMA sees BIG ED sitting by NADINE’S side. BIG ED wears a worried expression as he holds NADINE’S hand and rubs it. NORMA walks off.

We FOCUS on NADINE as she lies unconscious in bed, connected to a breathing machine. NADINE still wears her black eye patch. BIG ED continuously rubs NADINE’S hands.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Son.

BOBBY turns and see his father seated at a booth. BOBBY tries to hide his cigarette.

BOBBY
Dad.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Would you ... care to join me?

With a slight sigh, BOBBY puts out his cigarette by snuffing it out in an ash tray on the counter.

BOBBY
Okay.

BOBBY walks over to the booth where his father is seated and lays out on the open bench opposite his father. Along with a cup of coffee, MAJOR BRIGGS is eating a slice of pie.

MAJOR BRIGGS
How was school today?

BOBBY is surprised by the question.

BOBBY
School? Fine.

MAJOR BRIGGS
That’s good.

BOBBY

MAJOR BRIGGS
That’s classified.

BOBBY
Oh.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Bobby, would you care for a piece of pie? The huckleberries are particularly delicious today. Particularly fresh and delicious.

BOBBY
No thanks.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Bobby, may I share something with you?

BOBBY
Okay.

MUSIC: VISION OF YOU

MAJOR BRIGGS
A vision I ... had in my sleep last night. As distinguished from a dream which is mere ... sorting and cataloging of the day’s events by the subconscious. This was a vision. As clear as a mountain stream. The mind revealing itself to itself. In my vision I was on a veranda of a ... vast estate, a palazzo of some fantastic proportion. There seemed to emanate from it ... a light from within this ... gleaming, radiant marble. I’d known this place. I ... I in fact had been born and raised there. This was my first return. A reunion with the ... deepest well springs of my being.

BOBBY listens on but is a little bored.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Wandering about I noticed happily that the house had been immaculately maintained. There’d been added a number of additional rooms but ... in a way that blended so seamlessly with the original construction one would never detect any difference. Returning to the house’s grand foyer, came a knock on the door. My son was standing there.

BOBBY’S attention is grabbed.

MAJOR BRIGGS
He was happy and care free. Clearly living a life of ... deep harmony and joy. We embraced. Warm and loving embrace, nothing withheld. We were, in this moment, one. My vision ended and I awoke with a ... tremendous feeling of ... optimism and confidence in ... you and your future. That was my vision of you.

BOBBY has been listening intently and is now teary eyed.

BOBBY
Really?

MAJOR BRIGGS
I’m so .. glad to have had this opportunity to share it with you.

MAJOR BRIGGS stands up.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I wish you nothing but ... the very best in all things.

MAJOR BRIGGS and BOBBY shake hands.

BOBBY
Thank you, dad.

MAJOR BRIGGS
See you later. Call.

BOBBY
Okay.

MUSIC ENDS: VISION OF YOU

MAJOR BRIGGS walks off to the coat rack to collect his hat and coat.

At the counter, HANK turns towards MAJOR BRIGGS.

HANK
Major?

MAJOR BRIGGS turns to HANK.

HANK
How was the pie?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Exceptional, as always.

HANK salutes MAJOR BRIGGS. MAJOR BRIGGS exits the diner through the front door but as he does he passes NORMA, who enters the diner. NORMA enters the counter island. HANK faces NORMA directly.

HANK
How’s Shelly?

BOBBY overhears HANK and turns his head to look at him.

NORMA
I can’t talk right now.

NORMA passes HANK and walks straight into the kitchen. HANK yells to NORMA as she enters the kitchen.

HANK
Well how she’d like the flowers!

HANK turns and meets eyes with BOBBY. HANK throws his arms up showing his discord at NORMA’S lack of response. BOBBY waves to him an understanding. HANK throws the towel in his hand up, catches it and walks away. BOBBY recollects the events of the previous night ...


INSERT: BOBBY’S FLASHBACK

We view the contents of the events BOBBY experienced the previous night. Inside LEO JOHNSON’S house, A shot RINGS out. A bullet smashes through the window and sends LEO flying back onto the couch.

Through BOBBY’S POV we FOCUS on the bullet hole in the broken glass and then FOCUS outside on HANK, wearing a black leather jacket, standing outside as he looks towards the house. HANK walks off.

INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME (0:00 - 1:00)

AGENT COOPER sets at the short end of the conference table. Seated near COOPER, on the long end of the table, is AGENT ALBERT followed by SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY HAWK. The table is set up with nearly six dozen varieties of donuts, two pots of coffee, a stack of napkins and paper cups. DEPUTY ANDY sit opposite of COOPER on the other short end of the table. LUCY stands in the corner near ANDY and alongside the chalkboard which has a drawing of the map of the town. A collection of all the evidence involved in the PALMER case lays on the table near ANDY.

COOPER
The night Laura Palmer was killed, it appeared she made two appointments. In her diary she had written, ‘nervous about meeting ‘J’ tonight.’ I now believe this was a reference to James Hurley. She was nervous because she planned to tell him she didn’t want to see him any more. Before she snuck out of the house she received a phone call.

ALBERT
We believe it was Leo Johnson making the second appointment for sometime later that night.

COOPER
Laura met James, was with him until 12:30 ...

COOPER grabs himself a jelly donut. We PAN RIGHT to view the spread of donuts on the table.

COOPER
... when at the intersection of Sparkwood and 21 she jumped from the bike and ran into the woods.

SUPERIMPOSE: PINE TREES

As we PAN RIGHT to view the spread of donuts an additional scene is SUPERIMPOSED. We also view pine trees being blown in the wind.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
We believe it was there that she met up with Jacques Renault, Leo Johnson and Ronette Pulaski. Together they drove to the foot of the trail leading to Jacques’s cabin. They climbed the trail. They were heard passing by the cabin of the Log Lady. They reached Jacques Renault’s cabin at approximately 1 am. Drugs and alcohol were consumed. Laura was tied up and had sexual relations with both Leo and Jacques.

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: STREET INTERSECTION LIGHT

Along with the PANNING shot of the spread of donuts the SUPERIMPOSED scene of the blowing trees now gives way to a street intersection light that is showing red.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Waldo the bird was let out of his cage and attacked Laura. Leo and Jacques fought. Jacques went outside and passed out. When he came to, Leo and the girls were gone. We believe Leo hiked back down the trail to his corvette alone, leaving the girls behind.

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: TRAIN CAR

The SUPERIMPOSED scene of the street intersection light that is showing red gives way to an exterior view of the train car where some of the grisly evidence to the case was found. We continue to view the PANNING shot of the spread of donuts.

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
The reason being ... there was a third man.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Deputy Hawk found evidence of a third man outside the window of Jacques’s cabin.

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: BLOODY FLOOR AND HAMMER

The SUPERIMPOSED scene changes to a view inside the train car where a flashlight spot illuminate a bloody floor and hammer. We continue to view the PANNING shot of the spread of donuts.

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
The third man took Laura and Ronette to the train car where they were tied up. Laura for the second time, Ronette for the first.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Using a blunt object, the killer hit Ronette and knocked her unconscious. He must have been so intent on killing Laura he didn’t realize that ...

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: RONETTE AT THE BRIDGE

The SUPERIMPOSED scene now changes to a view of RONETTE as she was first found walking in a dirty slip on the bridge. We continue to view the PANNING shot of the spread of donuts.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
... Ronette regained conscious and escaped.

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
Either he didn’t know or he didn’t care. He made a small mound of dirt and put the half heart necklace of Laura’s on top.

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: MOUND OF DIRT

The SUPERIMPOSED scene changes back to a view inside the train car where a flashlight spot illuminate a mound of dirt with the gold half heart necklace on top. We continue to PAN the table but now view two pots of coffee.

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
He then placed a small cutout letter ‘R’ under the nail of her left ring finger.

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: LETTER UNDER FINGERNAIL

The SUPERIMPOSED scene now shows COOPER as he was digging under LAURA’S fingernail with some tweezers in the morge. We continue to SLOWLY PAN the table and view two pots of coffee.

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
You’ll recall that he placed the letter ‘T’ under the finger nail of Teresa Banks.

SUPERIMPOSE DISSOVLE TO: MOUND OF DIRT

The SUPERIMPOSED scene changes back to a view inside the train car where we view a flashlight spot illuminate the mound of dirt with a torn, crumpled piece of paper lying nearby.

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
He uh ... left a note written in blood, ‘fire walk with me.’

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Here’s the interesting thing. The blood on the note was tested. It doesn’t match Leo’s, Jacques’s, Laura’s or Ronette’s.

MUSIC ENDS: LAURA PALMER’S THEME (0:00 - 1:00)


BACK TO SCENE:

The SUPERIMPOSED scene disappears. We view only a PANNING shot of the table top which now bears a collection of the evidence: LAURA’S photograph, the bloody towel, the twine, LAURA’S diary and copies of FleshWorld.

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS (1:15 - 2:09)

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
So, we surmise the killer wrote the note in his own blood. Its a rare type, AB-. The towel that Deputy Hawk found five miles down the tracks was soaked in blood of that type. He also found, near the towel, scraps of faded paper.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
These scraps may have been left by the killer. They’ll be sent back to Washington D.C. for testing.

Holding a photograph of LAURA, ANDY begins to cry.

MUSIC ENDS: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS (1:15 - 2:09)

ALBERT
(smartass) I know Andy. I know, I know, I know. Its what we call a three hankie crime.

ANDY looks up from the photograph, looks at ALBERT, stands up and points at ALBERT.

ANDY
Albert Rozerfeld, I don’t like the way you talk smart about Sheriff Truman or anybody! You just shut your mouth!

ANDY walks out of the room and SLAMS the door behind himself. LUCY smiles to herself. EVERYONE looks at ALBERT. SHERIFF TRUMAN grins. ALBERT just rolls his eyes.

COOPER
Laura Palmer’s dead. Jacques Renault is dead. Ronette Pulaski and Leo Johnson are in comas. Waldo the bird is dead. This leaves only the third man.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
So where the hell is Josie?

PETE
Oh, well maybe this will tell us.

PETE opens the envelope, pulls out and unfolds a letter. PETE reads it outloud for SHERIFF TRUMAN.

PETE
Dear Pete. I had to leave the town on an emergency of business to Seattle. I will phone you when I arrive. Hope you did a good day at the mill. There is ginger beer in the refrig. Love Josie.

PETE folds the letter and returns it to its envelope.

PETE
There ya’ go.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Is there a phone number there?

PETE
No.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Does she say where she’s staying?

PETE
No no, she goes off to Seattle once every three months or so. You want my opinion, I think she goes over there to indulge a secret vice.

PETE looks at TRUMAN. Worried, TRUMAN’S eyes widen.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What’s that?

PETE
Shopping.

PETE chuckles.

PETE
Comes back with half a department store.

PETE laughs, which quickly becomes a slight nagging cough.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Pete, we haven’t found Catherine.

PETE takes a deep breath.

PETE
Yeah. (deep breath) I figured.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I know you want to hope for the best but ... you ought to prepare for the worst.

PETE takes another deep breath.

PETE
Oh dear. (teary eyed, sniffling) I always figured I’d be the one to go first. I mean if you was laying odds on the last person standing after an atomic war I’d bet on her.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah, she was a tiger alright.

PETE
Ahh no use mincing words, she was plain hell to live with. Plain hell. But once, there was a little bit of heaven there too.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Oh I’m sure there was.

PETE
(whispered) Oh god. This will take a little while to sink in I suppose.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I suppose it will.

TRUMAN puts an understanding hand on PETE’S shoulder.

PETE
God help her miserable soul. (in tears) I loved her.

Negative. He was chopping wood.

JERRY
Chopping wood? Inside?

HANK
Yeah you know Leo.

JERRY gets in HANK’S face.

Yeah you know Leo.

JERRY shakes his head in bewilderment.

Alright, what’s next? Catherine. Dead?

HANK

EILEEN
Gersten’s going to tell us about tonight’s proceedings. She has some very good news. We’re all very proud of her.

GERSTEN
Good evening. I’m Gersten Hayward and I would like to welcome you all to the Hayward supper club.

SARAH laughs.

GERSTEN
I’m going to be playing various selections of music for you this evening. My good news is that I was chosen to be the fairy princess in my school play. This is my special dress.

GERSTEN is wearing a tiara, a pink dress and is holding a wand.

GERSTEN
Also I got the highest scores in mathematics and English this midseason term. Just as my sisters Harriet and Donna did before me. (playfully, jokingly) So now I don’t have to worry about being ashamed anymore. Before I play, Harriet would like to read a poem about your daughter and our friend Laura.

HARRIET gets up from her seat and moves to where GERSTEN was standing. GERSTEN has moved to the nearby piano. HARRIET nods to GERSTEN to begin playing. LELAND, with a smile, and SARAH hold hands.

MUSIC: PIANO ???

HARRIET
Uhm. It was Laura and I saw her glowing. In the dark woods I saw her smiling. We were crying and I saw her laughing. In our sadness I saw her dancing. It was Laura living in my dreams. It was Laura. The glow was life. Her smile was to say it was alright to cry. The woods was our sadness. The dance was her calling. It was Laura and she came to kiss me goodbye.

I feel like I’ve sat through back to back operas. In med school we learned to live on three hours a night and cat naps.

LELAND
Its terrible about the mill.

DR. HAYWARD
Yeah. They say more then a hundred and fifty jobs may be lost.

LELAND
Awful just awful.

DR. HAYWARD
I uh suppose this uh will open the door for Ben Horne and his uh big development plans.

LELAND
Well as his lawyer, and yours, of course I can’t comment.

DR. HAYWARD
Well as your doctor Leland, what the hell happened to your hair?

The GROUP laugh slightly.

LELAND
It is strange isn’t it. Well I just uh ... I woke up this morning and looked in the mirror and there it was. It had literally changed overnight.

DR. HAYWARD
Well considering all you’ve been through.

LELAND
You know the funny thing about it is ... seeing it, I realized I had ... turned a corner somehow. I feel a great deal of sadness still, yes, but uh ... it wasn’t as overwhelming to me. I physically felt as if ... a great wave had been lifted from my heart.

DR. HAYWARD
Perhaps it has.

LELAND
(smiling) Perhaps it has, perhaps it has. God I feel like singing.

DR. HAYWARD
(surprised, politely) That would be very nice.

LELAND
No I really feel like singing a song.

LELAND stands up. DR. HAYWARD is surprised and is caught off guard by his actions. SARAH is a little worried.

SARAH
Leland?

LELAND
Come on everybody ... get happy.

MUSIC ENDS: MENDELHSON ???   91K

GERSTEN stops playing the piano as LELAND moves to her and asks her to play:

LELAND
Get happy.

GERSTEN
Get happy?

LELAND
Mm-hmm.

SONG: COME ON GET HAPPY

LELAND stands before the group at the table as he sings and dances slightly. The GROUP at the table all smile and laugh a little as LELAND sings.

LELAND
Forget your troubles and just get happy.
You got to pack all your cares away.
Sing hallelujah come on get happy.
Get ready for the judgment day.
The sun is shining come on get happy.
The lord is waiting to take your hand.
Sing hallelujah come on get happy.
We’re going to that promised land.
With a hand across the river wash your sins away in the tide.
Its oh so peaceful on the other side.
Forget your troubles come on get happy.
You better chase all your cares away.

LELAND starts to sing faster and faster.

LELAND
Sing hallelujah come on get happy.
Get ready for the judgment day.
Sing hallelujah come on get happy.
Sing hallelujah come on get happy.
Get ready for the judgment day.
Sing hallelujah come on get happy.

LELAND’S singing becomes somewhat mad and strained.

LELAND
Get ready for the judgment da...

SONG ENDS: COME ON GET HAPPY

LELAND stops singing and falls to the floor.

DR. HAYWARD
Donna get my bag.

DR. HAYWARD rushes to LELAND.

SARAH
Leland?

MADELEINE is by LELAND’S side holding his hand.

GERSTEN
Dad is he okay?

DR. HAYWARD
I’m sure its nothing serious.

DR. HAYWARD waves a bottle of smelling salts under LELAND’S nose. LELAND quickly comes to and lifts his head up.

LELAND
Oh god. I feel happy. (chuckle) I feel happy. Begin the Beguine

INT. DALE COOPER’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Ready for sleep dressed pajamas and under the sheets, AGENT COOPER speaks into his mini tape recorder.

COOPER
Diane its ... 11:55 pm. Approximately nineteen hours since the shooting incident which nearly caused me to make a premature purchase of the proverbial farm. I am dog tired. A man can only go so long without submitting to a period of rest. For as we know from experiments conducted on American GI’s during the Korean war; sleep deprivation is a one way ticket to temporary psychosis. And I’m working on a three day jag. I got so goofy last night Diane, lying here wondering whether I was going to live or die, that I thought I saw a giant in my room. Or perhaps that’s a story that I’ll save for another time. This is me, Dale. Room 315 at the Great Northern Hotel signing off.

AGENT COOPER turns his mini tape recorder off and places it on the bedside table. COOPER turns off the lights, lays back, comforts himself in his sheets and exhales deeply.




CUT TO:

INT. ONE-EYED JACKS - NIGHT

MUSIC: VISION OF YOU

Lying on her back on a bed, we view a CLOSE-UP of AUDREY’S face. AUDREY holds her hands together as if praying.

AUDREY
Special Agent. Special Agent. Special Agent. Special Agent are you there? I left you a note. Didn’t you get my note?

INSERT:

As AUDREY pleas for her savior, we view AGENT COOPER’S current state, sleeping peacefully in his bed at The Great Northern. We PAN DOWN to see an envelope lying on the floor beneath the bed.

AUDREY (OFF SCREEN)
I slipped it under your door you must have seen it. I’m up here at One-Eyed Jacks.

BACK TO SCENE:

Dressed in a black nightgown, AUDREY lies on her back on a bed holding her hands together as if praying.

AUDREY
To be perfectly honest I think I’m in a little over my head.

We SLOWLY ZOOM IN on AUDREY’S face. AUDREY fiddles with a small white pillow.

AUDREY
Not that I can’t handle it. I mean I’m going to help you out with your investigations. I’m sure I’ll be put into situations a lot more dangerous then this on a fairly regular basis. But its just ... you know, my first time out. I could use a little expert guidance. Just so you know, there is a connection between Horne’s Department Store and One-Eyed Jacks. Its my father, he owns the place. But a bald old sleaze named Battis helps to recruit some of the girls from the perfume counter. Tomorrow I’m going to try to find out if Laura and Ronette came up here. I hope you won’t think any less of me for trying to help you. You know I promised I’d only did it with the best of intentions. Then if there’s any way ... if there’s any way in the world that you can hear my right now. Please help me.

With tears in her eyes AUDREY clutches the pillow and with a slight cry in her voice, whispers:

AUDREY
Help me.

INT. DALE COOPER’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

In the dark, COOPER sleeps with an arm draped over his eyes. A shadow moves through the room. The shadow stands stationary and falls over the sleeping form of AGENT COOPER.

SOUND EFFECT: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING   20K

A hand waves through the air above COOPER to see if he notices and is awake. The hand is from the GIANT standing next to COOPER’S bed. The GIANT walks away. COOPER sleeps peacefully alone in his dark room.

A bright light illuminates the room and the GIANT materializes by the foot of the bed. COOPER awakens and moves his arm from his eyes. COOPER sees the GIANT.

GIANT
Sorry to wake you.

COOPER raises his head from the pillow.

COOPER
I am not dreaming.

GIANT
I forgot to tell you something.

COOPER
You were right about the smiling bag.

GIANT
The things I tell you will not be wrong.

COOPER opens his mouth to say something but the GIANT raises his left hand to stop him from speaking.

GIANT
Better to listen than to talk.

COOPER
I believe you.

GIANT
Don’t search for all the answers at once. A path is formed by laying one stone at a time.

COOPER nod his head for yes.

GIANT
One person saw the third man. Three have seen him, yes, but not his body. One only known to you. Ready now to talk. One more thing. You forgot something.

COOPER
What?

The GIANT raises his left hand. A bright light fills the room. A ball of light forms near the GIANT and flies toward COOPER.

SOUND EFFECT ENDS: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING   20K

The room falls dark again and the GIANT vanishes. COOPER slowly lays his head back down and thinks it over.
