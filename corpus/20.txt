LOG LADY
Is a dog man’s best friend? I had a dog. The dog was large. It ate my garden, all the plants, and much earth. The dog ate so much earth it died. Its body went back to the earth. I have a memory of this dog. The memory is all that I have left of my dog. He was black and white.

INT. BENJAMIN HORNE’S OFFICE - DAY

MUSIC: ANDY’S THEME   48K

We FOCUS on the closed double-doors to the office. Just to the side of the door is a small brass deer statue. The doors open and BOBBY BRIGGS lets himself into the office and closes the door behind himself. BOBBY peers to the left wall where most of the furniture in the room has been assembled on top of each other in a symmetrical fashion. Starring at the wall, he walks into the office.

BOBBY
Mr. Horne.

BOBBY walks around the desk, which sits in the middle of the room, and spots BENJAMIN HORNE. BEN, unshaven and wearing a robe with a loose odd necktie, sits quietly on the floor beside the assemblage of furniture. 

BOBBY
Mr. Horne? Your secretary said to come in.

Worried by BEN’S lack of response BOBBY gives his name in case he doesn’t remember him.

BOBBY
Bobby Briggs?

BENJAMIN
Bobby do you know what you have to have in this life? Hmm?

BOBBY shrugs.

BENJAMIN
Guts.

MUSIC: AUDREY’S DANCE (SAX ONLY)

BENJAMIN
Distance. Symmetry

Holding a lit cigar, BEN stands up and walks up to BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
Look.

BEN points to the assemblage of furniture.

BENJAMIN
Its a beautiful thing isn’t it? Hmm?

BEN walks over to the assemblage, climbs it and moves his wood carved nameplate, ‘BEN’, to a higher position on the assemblage.

BOBBY
Uhh Mr. Horne, did you listen to that tape I sent you?

Still standing on the assemblage, BEN turns and hunches down to BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
Yes I listened to your tape Bobby. Frankly, I am surprised that Leo could master the technology. (laughs) Damb it Bobby what do you want? Hmm?

BOBBY rakes his fingers together as he puts his hands together.

BOBBY
Mr. Horne I have a great admiration for you.

BENJAMIN
Admiration is for poets and dairy cows, Bobby.

BOBBY
I uh ... don’t know what you mean. I uh ...

BEN hops off the assemblage and stands next to BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
Bobby, you’re standing in front of a mammoth sky scraper.


INSERT: FURNITURE ASSEMBLAGE

We FOCUS on the symmetrical furniture assemblage and PAN UP to the top.

BENJAMIN (OFF SCREEN)
A leviathan that rips a hole in the clouds.


BACK TO SCENE:

BENJAMIN
Now, what is the first question that comes to your mind?

BEN takes a puff from his cigar. Baffled, BOBBY stares at the assemblage.

BOBBY
Uhmm.

BENJAMIN
The first question that you ask yourself is; ‘what’s on the top floor, who’s up there in the penthouse and why.’ Now that’s who I am.

BEN points at BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
Are you?

BOBBY turns to BEN.

BOBBY
Yeah, of course I am, yes.

Pleased, BEN extends an arm around BOBBBY and tugs at him.

BENJAMIN
Bobby (laughs) opportunity knocks.

BEN walks over to his desk, picks up a small brown leather case and opens it.

BENJAMIN
I want you to follow Hank Jennings.

BEN removes a camera from the case and hands it to BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
I want you to chronicle his existence.

BEN closes the leather case.

BENJAMIN
Show me something ... that I don’t already know.

CUT TO:

INT. THE GREAT NORTHERN - DAY

In the hallway just outside the double doors to BENJAMIN’S office, LANA BUDDING MILFORD, in a white dress, screams and runs gingerly in high heels around a bend in the hallway. BOBBY has just stepped out of BEN’S office as LANA runs by him screaming. Feigning fear or danger, LANA only briefly looks at BOBBY as she runs past him. Baffled by the commotion, BOBBY just shakes his head.

As BOBBY starts to walk off, he is jerked back and the case with the camera falls to the floor. The strap had gotten caught on the door handle. BOBBY picks up the camera case and untangles the strap from the door handle.

INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY


COOPER’S POV:

Through DALE COOPER’S POV, we FOCUS on a manila folder with a photograph of a house pasted to it along with a description of the house, a realtor summary.

COOPER
Hmm ... I’d like to see both.

We PAN RIGHT to another folder with a picture of a house on it with another realtor summary.


BACK TO SCENE:

Standing beside the end of the long desk in the conference room of the building, COOPER, dressed in khakis and a plaid flannel shirt, mulls through two different house selections in his hands. A chalk sketch of the map of Twin Peaks on a black board is a backdrop. Standing near COOPER, IRENE LITTLEHORSE, a realtor, asks ...

IRENE
Very good, which one would you like to see first?

COOPER
Well.

COOPER places the folders on the table and reaches into his pants pocket to retrieve a coin. With a flick of his thumb he tosses the coin up.


INSERT: COIN

We FOCUS on the coin as it flips around in the air in SLOW MOTION. The coin falls and ricochets off a plate of donuts on the table. The coin skips on the table top and comes to a rest on a folder scattered near a bunch of folders near IRENE.


BACK TO SCENE:

COOPER picks up the folder that the coin came to rest on. He catches the coin in his left hand as it slides off the top of the folder.

COOPER
What is this?

IRENE
I thought I’d taken that out. That property is called Dead Dog Farm and its worse than it sounds.

COOPER
What is it?

IRENE
A puzzle, no one ever really stays there long.

COOPER
(smiling) When can I see it?

DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN, LUCY MORAN and JUDIE SWAYNE, wearing a black and red plaid suit jacket with a black skirt and holding a manila folder, stand together in the waiting area of the reception room.

DICK
Sorry I’m late but the little nipper is so excited about our camping trip I just couldn’t coax him out of the car.

ANDY
Richard this is Judie Swayne from the Happy Helping Hands Organization.

JUDIE
I’m Little Nicky’s case manager.

JUDIE extends a hand for greetings to DICK. DICK shakes her hand.

DICK
(smiles) Charmed I’m sure. Shall we?

JUDIE
Sit down. Okay (clears her throat.)

They all take a seat. JUDIE opens the folder she has been holding, pulls out several documents and hands them to DICK.

JUDIE
Uhm as I was about to tell your uh friends, the number one thing to know about Nicky is that throughout his brief life he has been very confused and perhaps traumatized by a persistent random misfortune.

DICK
Looks like he’s bounced around quite a bit.

JUDIE
Oh yeah, well yes he has.

LUCY
Poor child.

JUDIE
Yes, an orphan you know.

ANDY
Really, what happened did his parents die?

DICK
(smiles at ANDY) Nicely deduced Andrew. (to JUDIE) Persistent random misfortune?

JUDIE
Uh they were killed.

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

DICK
How were they killed Miss Swayne?

JUDIE
Uh mysterious circumstances. I’m afraid the uh orphanage has never provided us with that information.

SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN quickly steps out of his office that opens out to the waiting area of the reception room. As he puts on his jacket and hat, he calls out for ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Andy let’s go, emergency at the Great Northern.

ANDY stands up and follows SHERIFF TRUMAN out of the building.

INT. DOUGIE MILFORD’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

In one of the bedrooms of the Great Northern hotel, we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the frozen face of DOUGLAS ‘DOUGIE’ MILFORD as he lies dead in bed. We ZOOM OUT. DR. WILL HAYWARD stands beside the bed as he moves his hand over DOUGIE’S eyes to close them. DR. HAYWARD looks over to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

DR. HAYWARD
Looks like a heart attack.

DEPUTY ANDY, standing next to DR. HAYWARD, reads aloud from a book he found in the room.

ANDY
Once stimulated the female will respond in such a way that the skin around her ...

ANDY looks up from the book and over to TRUMAN.

ANDY
... oh my god.

ANDY moves the book over to DR. HAYWARD to show him the racy description.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Looks like Dougie went out with his boots on.

TRUMAN looks at the books on the bed and reads the titles out loud.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Love poems of Lord Byron, the Kamasutra, Hookers and Handmaidens.

ANDY looks inside an open suitcase on the bed that is filled with fetish sex toys. ANDY picks up a translucent plastic mask from the suitcase, puts it over his face.

ANDY
Sheriff look at this.

ANDY turns to DR. HAYWARD, who is instantly repelled at the sight of the mask. ANDY removes the mask as he and DR. HAYWARD turn their attention to the door of the room as MAYOR DWAYNE MILFORD, DOUGIE’S brother, enters.

MUSIC: HAROLD’S THEME   32K

Wearing a black suit and carrying a rain coat over his left arm, MILFORD walks up to the bed.

MAYOR MILFORD
Well the falling out was here.

Standing over his brother, MILFORD bemoans the loss.

MAYOR MILFORD
Doug. Oh I hate to say it, but I told you so.

MILFORD touches his brother’s shoulder and his head. He looks down the bed and sees a book.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP BOOK

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP on the book ‘My Secret Life’ by Chris Gerrfey. MILFORD picks the book up.


BACK TO SCENE:

MILFORD passes the book to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

MAYOR MILFORD
Here sheriff. This is it, the murder weapon. She might as well as blown his brains out with a rifle.

MILFORD picks up his brother’s hand and gently places it on top of his brother’s chest. As he pats his brother’s hand, MILFORD remarks ...

MAYOR MILFORD
He never could say no to a woman. You old fool.

MILFORD turns to leave. DEPUTY ANDY places an arm around MILFORD to comfort him as ANDY escorts him out of the room.




CUT TO:

INT. THE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

Just outside DOUGIE’S hotel bedroom, DEPUTY TOMMY THE ‘HAWK’ HILL squats to the side of LANA MILFORD, who is seated in a chair, as he tries to comfort her. MAYOR MILFORD and DEPUTY ANDY step out of the bedroom and into the hall. DEPUTY HAWK stands up and grasps MILFORD’S left arm to help guide him. ANDY releases his hold and walks back into the bedroom. Spotting LANA, MILFORD points a finger at her.

MAYOR MILFORD
You sexual adventurous. You’ll burn in hell for this!

HAWK
Take it easy Mr. ...

Two nearby deputies, DEPUTY #1 and DEPUTY #2 grab an arm of MILFORD’S and slowly lead him up the hall away from LANA.

MAYOR MILFORD
I’m going to shout till ... to ... wake the dead ... she murdered my brother. She - she’s - she’s a witch.

The DEPUTIES lead MILFORD away. DEPUTY HAWK returns to a squat beside LANA and holds her hand to comfort her.

LANA
He’s right. I’m cursed.

MUSIC ENDS: HAROLD’S THEME   32K

HAWK
Don’t be silly.

LANA
No, no its true. It all started in high school. Prom night, my date went to kiss me, ...

LANA
... it was his first day with his new braces and they gleamed in the moon light, (slight cry in her voice) and his rubber band snapped and his jaw locked up and we ended up in the emergency room and - and the doctors had to break his jaw in three places to get it to shut and its just gotten worse ever since.

HAWK
A curse needs a cure. I know a bit about these things.

LANA
Are you the sheriff?

HAWK
Let’s just say ...

HAWK boldly stands up and leans back on the door to DOUGIE’S bedroom.

HAWK
... when something really big goes down, I’m the man.

Suddenly the door to the bedroom opens and HAWK’S eyes widen as he loses his balance, falls to his left side and back into the bedroom. Perplexed, DEPUTY ANDY stands in the doorway and stares at LANA.

COACH (OFF SCREEN)
Boys, there’s a story about a great football coach, ...



CUT TO:

INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

Inside the Twin Peaks High School gymnasium, we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP on the face of the WRESTLING COACH as he stands before students of the high school and tells them a story.

COACH
... whose name escapes me at this time, who was dead set against having a black players on his team. Until somebody brought him the finest black halfback anyone had ever seen. And when what’s his name saw him run fifty yards and no one lay a hand on him he shouted, ‘look at that indian go.’ That coach accepted that athlete’s desire to compete. Nadine.

We ZOOM OUT to see the WRESTLING COACH standing in the gymnasium. NADINE HURLEY, wearing a white Twin Peaks High School Physical Education T-shirt, quickly scampers down and stands beside the WRESTLING COACH.

COACH
Now today the story applies to this woman’s ... (corrects himself) this young girl’s right to compete. In addition to it being her moral and constitutional right. Mike Nelson, could you step up here for a second.

MIKE NELSON stands up from his seat on the bleachers and walks up to the WRESTING COACH. Several WRESTLERS, standing and seated on the wrestling mat, clap and cheer for MIKE.

WRESTLERS
(severally) Yeah ... ooh ... yeah get em’ killer ... come on Mike.

The COACH holds an arm over the shoulder’s of MIKE and NADINE as he boldly announces ...

COACH
Now Nadine has chosen to prove herself to us by taking on our very best. Our very own district champion, Mike Nelson.

The COACH tugs MIKE close.

WRESTLERS
(severally) Yeah ... come on ... oh-ho ... alright ... go Mike.

The WRESTLING COACH stands at the edge of the mat with a whistle in his mouth as he acts as the referee. Facing each other hunched over, MIKE and NADINE square off in the middle of the wrestling mat. MIKE reaches out, grabs NADINE by the back of the neck and pulls her towards him until the top of her head rests on his left shoulder.

NADINE
Hi Mike.

MIKE reaches out for NADINE’S right hand, grabs it and throws it on his back shoulder. NADINE slides her right hand over to his neck.

MIKE
Put your hand here.

MIKE grabs her right hand again and places it back on the back of his left shoulder.

MIKE
No here. Alright now just push against me. I’ll try not to hurt ya’.

MIKE and NADINE waddle together as they push each other around on the mat.

NADINE
Want to go out tonight?

MIKE
This is called a Tie Hand.

MIKE quickly releases his grip, moves behind NADINE, throws his arms around her waist and picks her up. MIKE looks over to his COACH, who appears disappointed by the move. Releasing his grip, NADINE reaches behind to her right, grabs a hold on MIKE and throws him down hard to the mat.

COACH
Oh yeah.

The WRESTLERS all mumble to themselves.

MIKE
You stupid ...

NADINE
What did you say Mike?

MIKE gets back up and moves back into a starting position by hunching over and extending his arms to grab NADINE. NADINE quickly grabs MIKE’S neck and places him in a headlock. She jerks him around slightly as she holds his neck tight.

MIKE
(straining) You’re breaking my neck.

NADINE
You’re right this is sort of like necking.

NADINE jerks MIKE and throws him down hard to the mat. MIKE stumbles on the ground as he looks over to his WRESTLING COACH. NADINE picks MIKE up from the floor to stand him up. She then gets a grip on his leg and his shirt and lifts him up into the air and over her head.

NADINE
What about tonight?

MIKE
Coach?

The WRESTLING COACH quietly stares in awe as he watches NADINE spin MIKE around in the air.

MIKE
Hey coach?

NADINE throws MIKE into the air and he falls hard onto the mat. Some of the WRESTLERS close their eyes with MIKE’S brutal collision with the floor.

WRESTLERS
(severally) Oh ... get up ... oh god.

NADINA pounces on MIKE’S chest and pins him to the mat. The COACH quickly walks up to the two and counts ...

COACH
One, two and three.

NADINE
Now will you go out with me?

NADINE gets up from MIKE. Pained, MIKE lifts his head up to look at NADINE and then drops it back to the mat.

DONNA

MIKE

DONNA grins at MIKE and jokingly asks ...

MIKE
I don’t want to go out with anyone who can body slam me.

DONNA
Well what do you want me to do about it?

MIKE

Hang up a local servants rebellion. I wonder if you’d help me bundle up loose sticks and burn their master. (introduces himself) Malcolm.

MALCOLM extends his hand. JAMES and MALCOLM shake hands.

Well that’s the nice thing about ... things. You know when she and Jeffrey fell in love he gave her a whole new life that’s for sure, ...

MALCOLM grabs a chair and moves it over in front of JAMES. MALCOLM extends his arms out as he shows his uniform.

MALCOLM

MALCOLM sits down.

MALCOLM
And the keys to the liquor cabinet.

MALCOLM takes a big swig from his glass.

MALCOLM
Sonny boy nobody stops Mr. Marsh. That’s the golden rule around here. You can jot that down and put it under your pillow.

MALCOLM takes a swig from his glass and then stands up. Before he leaves he extends his hand towards JAMES.

I just had the car checked and gassed. They told me it was in perfect working order. Perfect working order.

When you were at the sight did you notice any wildlife in the area?

COOPER
Wildlife?

COLONEL RILEY
Birds, owls ...?

COOPER
Yes, yes just moments before the Major disappeared I heard an owl.

MUSIC: HOLDING OUT   12K

COLONEL RILEY
Any visual contact?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Look Colonel, (RILEY turns to TRUMAN) Garland Briggs is a good friend of mine. Be a lot better if you’d just leveled with us.

COOPER
We know about the monitors and the messages from deep space that you received pertaining to me.

COLONEL RILEY
You may know something but ... you’d best get your facts straight. Our monitors are pointed at deep space but the messages we intercepted, that Briggs showed you, were sent from right here in these woods.

RILEY points to a position on a map on top of TRUMAN’S desk.

COLONEL RILEY
And where they were sent to is another question.

COOPER
Might this have something to do with a place called the white lodge?

COLONEL RILEY
That’s classified.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Colonel, we’d like to help you but you need to give us a little more to go on here.

Looking at TRUMAN, RILEY leans on TRUMAN’S desk.

COLONEL RILEY
Garland Briggs is the best pilot I’ve ever known. He was born with hardware most of us only dream about. I can tell you this, his disappearance has implications that go so far beyond national security ... the cold war seems like a case of the sniffles.

COOPER can only contemplate over COLONEL RILEY’S limited information.

AUDREY HORNE leans back against a wall in a corner of the hallway. BOBBY BRIGGS, dressed in a suit and carrying the leather camera case, walks into the corridor holding a manila envelope. BOBBY doesn’t notice AUDREY as he walks up the hallway. AUDREY quickly walks up behind him, moves around his right side (BOBBY looks over his left shoulder as he hears footsteps) and faces BOBBY.

AUDREY
(big smile) Well look who’s here. Did daddy have a change of heart?

BOBBY
Daddy just made the smartest decision that he’s made all year.

AUDREY
Oh yeah, that doesn’t say much. What’d he do?

BOBBY
He put me on the pay roll.

AUDREY slyly laughs as she playfully jabs BOBBY at his ribs.

AUDREY
Bobby, you junior achiever you.

AUDREY tugs at BOBBY’S arm. BOBBY stops walking, turns to AUDREY and holds before her the manila envelope he’s been carrying.

BOBBY
And uh this right here (manila envelope) this is my first assignment.

AUDREY
Ah, anything I can help you with?

AUDREY reaches out for the manila envelope but BOBBY whips it out of her reach and holds it behind his back.

BOBBY
Maybe. Maybe you could help me celebrate ...

BOBBY touches AUDREY’S cheek.

BOBBY shows AUDREY the envelope again.

AUDREY
Want to know what I think Bobby Briggs?

She reaches out for the envelope and BOBBY quickly slips it behind his back again.

BOBBY
Tell.

AUDREY grabs BOBBY’S suit collar.

AUDREY
I think ... that we should think ... about doing ... business ... together.

BOBBY moves his head towards AUDREY for a kiss but AUDREY moves aside. Missing the kiss and with his head bowed, BOBBY chuckles and then lifts his head back up. He points at AUDREY.

BOBBY
Audrey, I like the way you think.

BOBBY walks off.

AUDREY
Thank you.

INT. BENJAMIN HORNE’S OFFICE - DAY

On top of BENJAMIN’S desk, in the center of the office, is a model of a hill complete with small trees and vegetation. A confederate flag on a flagpole stands next to the desk. From the top of the model hill, smoke billows up into the air. BOBBY walks into the office and up to the model.

BOBBY
Hey Mr. Horne, how’s it going?

BENJAMIN sits up from behind the model and places a tiny half-inch tall confederate soldier on the top of the hill on the model. Smoking a cigar, BEN is dressed in the gray uniform of a confederate soldier.

BOBBY
What uh ... is this that you’re doing here exactly?

BENJAMIN
Gettysburg, day one. The South is winning.

BOBBY
I followed Hank. I got those pictures you wanted.

BOBBY extends the manila envelope to BEN. BEN smiles as he puts a small bottle of glue and his cigar down and grabs the envelope. BEN opens the envelope and pulls out several large 8.5 inch by 11 inch photographs.

BOBBY
You see, I - I don’t know what he’s up to but I’m sure its no good.

BOBBY
Well I - I like you too.

BENJAMIN
How much am I paying you?

We FOCUS on AUDREY as she stands close to the wall looking through the small knot hole into the office and listening in on BEN’S conversation.

BOBBY (OFF SCREEN)
Uh well - well we haven’t actually discussed money.


AUDREY’S POV:

From AUDREY’S POV looking through the knot hole in the wall, we see BENJAMIN reach into his confederate uniform jacket pocket and pull out a wad of cash. BEN passes several bills to BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
Uh huh, well consider this your first raise. Now you come back tomorrow and we will discuss a full time position.

BEN salutes BOBBY and then returns to looking at the photographs. Elated, BOBBY smiles and pats BEN on the back.

BOBBY
Thank you. Ben, I won’t let you down.

BOBBY walks off.

CATHERINE
Ooh.

PETE
Nectar of the gods my dear.

PETE pours the champagne into tall, thin champagne glasses. CATHERINE smiles lovingly at PETE. They both stare into each other’s eyes. CATHERINE lifts her glass to her lips. PETE holds his glass up to CATHERINE.

PETE
Its the bubbles.

CATHERINE abstains from drinking as she listens to PETE recite ...

PETE
Wine comes in at the mouth. Love comes in at the eye. I touch my glass to my lips. I look at you and sigh.

CATHERINE
(smiling brightly) Thank you Pete. That’s very lyrical.

PETE
Its Yates.

CATHERINE downs her glass of champagne.

PETE
He’s a poet.

CATHERINE

In the nearby kitchen, JOSIE PACKARD, dressed in a maid’s outfit, stops her work as she prepares the meal and walks over to the dining room table.

JOSIE
Yes.

CATHERINE
We’ll have our appetizers now.

Buzzed from the champagne, PETE smiles contently.

JOSIE
Yes.

CATHERINE
Oh Josie, I just want you to know that even though your station in this household has changed I intend to show you all the respect and affection that you deserve.

JOSIE
Thank you Catherine ... and I’ll try to do the same.

JOSIE turns around to return to the kitchen.

CATHERINE
Oh and put on your little maid’s cap.

JOSIE turns to face CATHERINE, grabs her little maid’s cap off of the corner of the kitchen island counter and places it on her head. Before she returns to the kitchen, JOSIE smirks with a tilt to her head that shifts her maid’s cap.

PETE
Catherine, don’t you think maybe you’re being a little hard on her? I mean she is still part of the family.

CATHERINE
Josie had a hand in Andrew’s death and she did everything in her power to destroy me. She’s lucky she not hanging from a tree.

PETE
(shrugs) I don’t believe it. Not the Josie I know.

PETE stares into the bottom of his glass. CATHERINE lifts her glass up.

CATHERINE
I would like to propose a toast to Ben Horne’s double cross, here’s to Josie Packard’s dirty deeds and here’s to the woman who brought them down. Here’s to me.

PETE and CATHERINE touch glasses for the toast.

BACK TO SCENE:

We FOCUS on COOPER sitting on his bed as he speaks into his mini-tape recorder.

COOPER
... printed in the personal columns per my instructions, but I’ve already received his response to this ... yesterday. He anticipated my response to his opening move perfectly. He’s toying with my Diane. I wonder where he is, what he’s planning. Meanwhile I’ve spent the past two days without badge and gun the best way I know how; occupying both body and spirit. Looked into some real estate, what the local agent charitably refers to as a fixer upper. None the less its the kind of place where a man might make a home, raise a family. Which is something, in spite of my past, I still hope I’m able to do. However, as is the case here in Twin Peaks, even this bucolic hideaway is filled with secrets. Secrets that may be connected to my trouble at the bureau and the cocaine that was found in my automobile. Agent Hardy’s deliberations will soon be completed and if I’m not adequately able to defend myself there’s a very real possibility of imprisonment.

COOPER stops recording.


COOPER’ POV:

Through COOPER’S POV, we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of COOPER’S hands as he holds his mini-tape recorder in his left hand and a Bookhouse Boy’s patch, a round white patch with a pine tree and sword overlapping each other, in his right hand.


BACK TO SCENE:

There’s a KNOCK at the door. Sitting near the nightstand at the head of his bed, COOPER stands up to answer the door. He puts his mini-tape recorder in his flannel shirt pocket. COOPER opens the door to reveal AUDREY carrying a manila envelope.

AUDREY
Hello Agent Cooper.

COOPER
Audrey?

AUDREY walks inside. COOPER closes the door and walks up to her.

AUDREY
This is for you. I stole it.

COOPER
Don’t you think you better give it back?

AUDREY
Not until you look at what’s inside.

COOPER smiles.

COOPER
Okay.

He grabs the manila envelope from AUDREY.

COOPER
What am I going to find in here Audrey?

AUDREY
Pictures my father paid for.

COOPER opens the envelope and pulls out several large black and white photographs.


COOPER’S POV:

Through COOPER’S POV we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the black and white photographs. The photograph is taken from outside the Dead Dog Farm house where a group of four men, ERNIE NILES, HANK JENNINGS, RMCP PRESTON KING, and JEAN RENAULT, huddle together in a meeting. COOPER flips to the next photograph which is a zoom in shot of the meeting.

AUDREY takes a seat on a chair near the window.

AUDREY

COOPER
Denise.

DENISE
Hi Coop.

COOPER
Come in.

COOPER hugs DENISE in the doorway. AUDREY stares in shock at the exchange between the two.

DENISE walks inside and COOPER closes the door. Surprised, off guard and even slightly jealous AUDREY asks ...

AUDREY
Sorry, am I interrupting something?

COOPER introduces DENISE to AUDREY ...

COOPER
Special Agent Denise Bryson, Drug Enforcement Agency. (gestures to AUDREY) This is a very good friend of mine, Audrey Horne.

AUDREY rises from her chair and walks over to DENISE. DENISE offers a hand to shake in greeting. AUDREY shakes hands with DENISE.

AUDREY
They have women agents?

DENISE
More or less.

AUDREY stares at DENISE in admiration. COOPER, standing next to DENISE, smiles at the reaction of the two.

COOPER
Audrey if you’ll excuse us, agency business.

AUDREY
I - I thought you were suspended?

COOPER
I am. Thanks again, good night.

AUDREY puts her hands on her hips as she continues to look at DENISE in awe. DENISE responds in kind, with hands at hips.

AUDREY

BACK TO SCENE:

As DENISE looks at the photographs, COOPER reaches over to the top of a dresser for the plastic envelope filled with the cocaine evidence he found at Dead Dog Farm. COOPER holds the plastic envelope in front of him as he explains ...

COOPER
In the kitchen I found traces of cocaine in a baby laxative used to step it out. I think if you compare this which is taken from the farm with the stuff found from my automobile you find it to be a match.

DENISE grabs the plastic envelope, looks it over and turns to COOPER.

DENISE
That’s good news Coop.

COOPER
Yeah.

DENISE
Now can we talk about something more important?

MUSIC: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN (W/O SAX)

DENISE

COOPER grabs DENISE’S left arm and leads to the door.

COOPER
Denise, I would assume you were no longer interested in girls?

COOPER opens the door.

DENISE
Coop I may be wearing a dress ... but I still put my panties on one leg at a time.

Standing near the open door, DENISE cups COOPER’S neck with a left hand.

DENISE
If you know what I mean.

DENISE walks out of the room.

COOPER
Not really.

COOPER closes the door and shakes his head at DENISE’S odd remark.

Dwayne, Dougie died of natural causes, heart attack. No evidence of foul play.

MAYOR MILFORD
Hmm-hmm, did you check him for witchcraft?

DR. HAYWARD
That’s uh not the kind of thing that shows up in an autopsy.

At the next door to the left of TRUMAN’S office, DEPUTY HAWK stands in the doorway of the conference room with LANA, wearing a little black dress, standing behind him. HAWK asks ...

Oh she doth teach the torches to burn bright.

Seeing that the commotion if over LANA, LUCY rolls her eyes and walks back to her office.

DICK
It seems she hangs against the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear.

Beauty to rich for use. For Earth too dear.

HAWK turns to look at LANA, who beguilingly leans back against the doorframe. Unaware that she was there, HAWK gives the four in the reception area a dirty look. HAWK turns to LANA, nods at her, caresses her left arm and leads her back into the conference room.

Hmm.

LUCY walks out of her office and up to the closed door to SHERIFF TRUMAN’S office. She leans her head to the door and listens to LANA’S voice.

LANA (OFF SCREEN)

Tell us another one, please Lana. One more.

LUCY becomes aghast at the site of DEPUTY ANDY sitting in a corner of the room. With his hands clumped together, ANDY stares at LANA with an enchanted yearning look on his face. ANDY stands up, grabs a pitcher of milk (sitting atop of TRUMAN’S desk), and fills a glass.

LANA
This one time I had this cousin who was a clown in this rodeo, you know, and they just had all these really big horses, you know, and you will not believe what they made him do.

GROUP
(several) What?

ANDY passes the glass of milk to LANA.

LANA
They made him, thank you.

LANA grabs the glass of milk and sets it down on the desk in front of her.

LANA
They made him stand in the middle and take his clown costume completely off.

Ignored and jealous, LUCY bites her lip, takes a step back out of the TRUMAN’S office and SLAMS the door shut.

We FOCUS on the face of the WOMAN standing next to ERNIE’S booth - it is AGENT DENISE. DENISE takes a seat opposite ERNIE at his booth. Puzzled, ERNIE looks around the diner and then asks ...

ERNIE
Can I help you?

Sitting cross-legged on the corner of the bench seat, DENISE holds up the black and white photographs received from COOPER.

DENISE
Mr. Niles I don’t want to put the squeeze on you.

DENISE places the pictures on the table and slides them over to ERNIE.

DENISE
You’ve been to prison. I don’t need to paint you any pictures.

DENISE flashes a DEA badge. ERNIE picks the photographs up and looks at them.

ERNIE
What’s this all about?

DENISE
For starters, you’re guilty of a serious parole violation.

DENISE grabs a compact mirror from the purse, opens the compact mirror and looks into it.

DENISE
Ah.

DENISE grabs a lipstick from the purse.

DENISE
Enough to put you back inside.

DENISE applies lipstick and continues to add ...

DENISE
Now unless you cooperate I intend to do everything in my power to (finished with lipstick, smiles) make sure you stay there.

CUT TO:

INT. DALE COOPER’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A fierce rain storm causes the lights to flicker and the room goes dark momentarily as blue lightning, which flashes the interior as thunder rumbles, disrupts the power service. We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of ERNIE’S face as he confesses ...

ERNIE
My name is Ernie Niles and I confess. I’m guilty.

The room grows dark as another bolt of lightning disrupts the power and flashes the room with blue light. Thunder pounds outside and power returns to the interior.

ERNIE
I guess I’m terribly guilty. Against my will of course.

Again the room becomes dark and lightning washes blue light into the room. Thunder rumbles outside. The interior lights return.

DENISE (OFF SCREEN)
Mr. Niles were not really interested in all that ...

We slowly ZOOM OUT and PAN RIGHT.

ERNIE
They held me at gun point. They beat me. They threatened me with physical violence. These men are animals they’ll stop at nothing.

COOPER stands next to the left of ERNIE. Bright blue lightning flashes outside.

COOPER
Mr. Niles just ...

ERNIE
They wanted me to sell drugs for them. I tried to resist but my family means everything to me.

The room becomes dark. Thunder rumbles and lightning flashes from the window. The lights in the room return. We slowly ZOOM OUT further.

ERNIE
They threatened my family and when they threatened my wife well I weakened you know. Look I’m terribly terribly sorry. I guess I did wrong but love ... love makes a guy do foolish things, you know, illegal things.

ERNIE is sitting on a chair near the foot of the bed. DENISE sits on the log wood bed railing at the foot of the bed next to the right of ERNIE. COOPER sits on the corner of a short dresser.

DENISE
Ernie Ernie Ernie, will you shut up.

With the sound of pouring rain outside, the lights go out as lightning once again disrupts the power momentarily.

COOPER
Mr. Niles we appreciate the trials you’ve been through. We sympathize with you.

ERNIE
You do?

COOPER
That’s why we’re here.

ERNIE
Oh - oh you are?

DENISE puts a hand on ERNIE’S right shoulder.

DENISE
Yes, now tell us everything you know.

The lights go out and then return again as they are disrupted by a bright flash of lightning followed by crashing thunder.

ERNIE
Yes Mrs. uh ... well they tortured me and the thing was that they’re filthy, horrible, disgusting ...

DENISE shrugs in disappointment. The lights briefly dim. Lightning flashes in the window.

COOPER
Mr. Niles please, just the information pertaining to the selling of drugs if you please.

ERNIE
Oh that yeah, yeah well they got uhm ... 4 kilos of cocaine to sell so uh ... they’re looking for a buyer.

The intense storm darkens the room once more. Bright blue light illuminates the interior and a loud boom of thunder roars. After a short duration in the dark, the lights return to normal.

ERNIE
So to protect my family I uh told them I’d go find one.

COOPER
Have you?

ERNIE
Oh me (laughs) are you kidding I don’t know anybody that would do anything like that.

ERNIE cowers in his seat. DENISE reaches out and picks up ERNIE’S right hand.

DENISE
You do now.

Another close bolt of lightning shuts the power down and flashes the interior. After a quake of thunder, the power returns.

DENISE caresses ERNIE’S hand. ERNIE stares nervously at his hand and at DENISE.

DENISE
A major drug trafficker will arrive from Seattle tomorrow.

COOPER stands up and paces the floor behind ERNIE.

DENISE
You will set up a meet with these men at the Dead Dog Farm.

ERNIE
I will? How will I uh ...

The lights momentarily go out. Lightning flashes and thunder growls.

ERNIE
... how will I know him?

COOPER stops and looks at DENISE’S and ERNIE’S reaction.

DENISE
You’re looking at him.

ERNIE jerks his hand out of DENISE’S grasp and looks at DENISE’S dress.

ERNIE
Him?

DENISE pats ERNIE on the right shoulder. ERNIE’S reaction generates a smile on DENISE’S face. ERNIE stands up.

ERNIE
Excuse me, I’ve got a nervous bladder.

COOPER watches ERNIE walk off to the bathroom.

INT. MARSH RESIDENCE SERVANT’S QUARTERS - NIGHT


JAMES’S POV:

Through JAMES’S POV we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the window looking outside towards the Marsh’s residence. Rain splatters the window and lightning flashes outside. JEFFREY’S voice can be heard shouting from inside the Marsh’s residence.

JEFFREY (OFF SCREEN)
The Jag why! Why!


BACK TO SCENE:

We FOCUS on JAMES as he lies awake in bed looking out the window. Lightning flashes the interior and thunder crackles. JAMES turns on the bedside lamp, gets out of bed and walks over to the window.

JEFFREY (OFF SCREEN)
Why would you drive it! Its a stick for Christ’s sake!

EVELYN shouts back at JEFFREY.

JEFFREY (OFF SCREEN)
You could of driven it then!

Lightning flashes blue light through the window.

JEFFREY (OFF SCREEN)
You could of driven it then!

An object can be heard SHATTERING inside the Marsh’s residence.

JAMES’S POV:

Through JAMES’S POV we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the window looking outside towards the Marsh’s residence. As it pours outside, JEFFREY’S voice can be heard shouting from inside the Marsh’s residence.

JEFFREY (OFF SCREEN)
Its a challenge for you!


BACK TO SCENE:

We FOCUS on the door to JAMES’S room as it opens and MALCOLM steps inside carrying a glass half-filled with liquor. JEFFREY’S voice can still be heard shouting from the Marsh’s residence. MALCOLM looks towards the window where JAMES is standing.

JEFFREY (OFF SCREEN)
You know something ...

Lightning flashes the room with blue light. JAMES turns to MALCOLM.

JAMES
Is she gonna be okay?

MALCOLM
The first time he beat her I swore revenge, something violent and noble.

Standing in the doorway, MALCOLM looks back into the other room.

MALCOLM
She beg me not to hurt him, made me promise, said it was for both our sakes.

MALCOLM leans on the door jamb and looks back at JAMES.

MALCOLM
That was four years ago. One day I’ll swear I’ll kill him. No matter what it costs.

MALCOLM turns around and walks off. JAMES watches him leave and then turns to face the window just as a very bright flash of lightning illuminates the room.

CUT TO:

EXT. BRIGGS HOUSE - NIGHT

An establish shot. In the pouring rain, we view the front of the house with a flag pole in the front yard.




CUT TO:

INT. BRIGGS HOUSE - NIGHT

Situated in the dark interior of the living room, we FOCUS on a window far at the end of the dining room. A FIGURE sits in the dark on a couch in the living room. Lightning flashes outside and illuminates the interior as the front door, to the left, opens. BOBBY walks into the house and across the room. The FIGURE watches BOBBY enter and moves to turn on a nearby lamp. Spooked, BOBBY jumps slightly and turns to see his mother, ELIZABETH BRIGGS, wearing a light blue robe, sitting on the couch.

BOBBY
Geez Ma give me a heart attack.

The base of the lamp, on top of the endtable next to ELIZABETH, is a large ceramic white owl.

ELIZABETH
I’m sorry.

BOBBY
What are you doing here sitting alone in the dark?

BOBBY places his car keys on a nearby table. He walks up to his mother and brushes his hair back with both hands.

ELIZABETH
Nothing, just sitting here.

BOBBY squats down and kneels just to the side of, but facing, his mother.

BOBBY
Well read a book or something mom, its creepy.

Holding a Kleenex tissue in her hands, ELIZABETH tries to hold a smile but she bows her head and lets out a whimper.

BOBBY
(concerned) Its dad right?

ELIZABETH quietly nods for yes. Thunder crackles for an extend time.

BOBBY
He’ll be back. You know he will. This is just some of that top secret jazz.

ELIZABETH
I’m not so sure this time.

BOBBY reaches into his shirt pocket and grabs a packet of cigarettes. He quickly jerks the packet in his hands to dispel a cigarette that he grabs with his lips.

ELIZABETH looks out towards the window in the dining room as lightning flashes and thunder loudly rattles nearby.

BOBBY grabs his lighter and, with a flick of the wrist, opens it. He lights his cigarette and holds it aside.

BOBBY
I was at the Double R a couple of weeks ago, Dad and I, we ... had this talk ...

MUSIC: VISION OF YOU

BOBBY
... about this dream he had. It was a big house made of white marble and lots of lights. Dad was there and I was there too.

ELIZABETH smiles as she listens to BOBBY’S recall of the dream.

BOBBY
Living a life of deep harmony and joy, or something like that, and there was all this stuff about my future, good stuff.

The room goes dark as a bolt of lightning interferes with the power service. Bright blue light flashes the dark interior. With the rumble of thunder the lights return.

BOBBY
Kinda’ nuts ... but I think he’s cool.

ELIZABETH
Your father is an extraordinary human being.

BOBBY takes a drag on his cigarette.

BOBBY
My father is a deeply weird individual, but he has a lot more going ...

BOBBY taps the side of his head.

BOBBY
... on in his head than most people that’s for sure.

ELIZABETH peers up as she recounts ...

ELIZABETH
Sometimes when I’m sleeping ... he runs his fingers through my hair ...

Lightning flashes outside and thunder rustles. BOBBY reaches out and holds his mother’s left hand. ELIZABETH becomes upset and lets out a small cry as she recounts the memory of her husband.

ELIZABETH
... and he thinks I don’t notice that.

The lights go out. Thunder crackles as a bright flash of blue light from a bolt of lightning illuminates the interior. ELIZABETH looks to her left, into the dining room, and is stunned by the sight of a FIGURE standing in the dark. Noting her reaction, BOBBY turns to look over his shoulder.

Another bolt of lightning brightens the dark interior and illuminates the FIGURE - its MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS, dressed in a World War II aviator outfit.

MAJOR BRIGGS
How long have I been gone?

ELIZABETH
Two days.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Strange, it seemed much shorter.

The lights return as power is restored. MAJOR BRIGGS removes the aviator cap and a white scarf around his neck. ELIZABETH jumps up from her seat and rushes over to hug MAJOR BRIGGS. The two embrace each other. MAJOR BRIGGS kisses her cheek.

ELIZABETH
Garland oh!

Stunned, BOBBY stands up. The lights flicker along with a crack of thunder. MAJOR BRIGGS looks at BOBBY.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Bobby I want you to put out that cigarette.

BOBBY looks at the cigarette he holds in his left hand. He quickly turns around and puts it out into an ash tray on the coffee table. Wide-eyed, BOBBY walks up to his dad.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Then I’d like you to fix me a cocktail. A strong one if you don’t mind.

BOBBY
Sure dad.

BOBBY walks off to fetch the drink. MAJOR BRIGGS and ELIZABETH still hold each other. They kiss. Lightning flashes.

ELIZABETH
Is everything alright?

MUSIC ENDS: VISION OF YOU

The lights flicker and then go out as thunder rattles the house.

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS

MAJOR BRIGGS
No dear, not exactly.

As lightning flashes the interior, MAJOR BRIGGS and ELIZABETH hold onto each other in the dark.
