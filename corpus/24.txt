INT. LOG LADY’S CABIN - DAY

MUSIC: CALL OF THE BLACK LODGE     272K

As she speaks directly to us, the ‘LOG LADY’ MARGARET LANTERMEN holds her wooden log in her arms like a baby. The LOG LADY sits with her back to the fireplace of her cabin and beside a table.

LOG LADY
A hotel. A nightstand. A drawer pull on the drawer. A drawer pull of a nightstand in the room of a hotel. What could possibly be happening on or in this drawer pull? How many drawer pulls exist in this world? Thousands, maybe millions? What is a drawer pull? This drawer pull - why is it featured so prominently in a life or in a death of one woman who was caught in a web of power?


CLOSE ON: LOG LADY

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP on the face of the LOG LADY.

LOG LADY
Can a victim of power end in any way connected to a drawer pull? How can this be?

INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

MUSIC: WINDOM EARLE’S THEME

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of an ornamental owl in a small glass case sitting on the corner edge of TRUMAN'S desk. WINDOM EARLE'S voice emanates from a recording.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
Now Dale, listen carefully its your move. Please, put your heart into it will you.

We PAN RIGHT to a CLOSE-UP on a chessboard sitting atop TRUMAN'S desk.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
I’ve noticed a certain tentative quality in your thinking as if your mind were occupied with issues other then those on the board before you.

We PAN RIGHT to a CLOSE-UP on a white mask, the mask taken from COOPER'S hotel room.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
Such preoccupation not only weakens one’s resolve but one’s foresight as well.

We PAN RIGHT to a CLOSE-UP on the mini tape recorder WINDOM EARLE left along with the white mask in COOPER'S hotel room.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
A deadly failing in any match you must agree but in this particular contest quite disastrous ...

We ZOOM OUT. SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN sits behind his desk drinking a cup of coffee as he listens to WINDOM'S tape.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
… as we play for grave stakes the likes of which you have no doubt surmised. Print your move in tomorrow’s paper or I will make it for you.

MUSIC ENDS: WINDOM EARLE’S THEME

Dressed in a plaid flannel shirt and khakis, DEPUTY DALE COOPER sits a chair in front of TRUMAN'S desk. COOPER reaches out and shuts off the mini tape player.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ah that tears it, Cooper I’m not letting you out of my sight.

COOPER
Harry if Windom wanted to kill me I’d already be dead.

TRUMAN nods his head for yes.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah.

COOPER
Better get Pete on the horn.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Right.

TRUMAN slides the speakerphone unit over to himself and depresses a button.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy call Pete Martell. Get him over here right away. Then call the paper. Find out the latest possible deadline for tomorrow’s personal’s columns.

COOPER places his cup of coffee on top of TRUMAN'S desk and looks at the white mask lying on the table.

MUSIC: QUESTION IN A WORLD OF BLUE (NO VOCALS)

LUCY (OFF SCREEN)
(over the intercom) Paper and Pete, got it. I’ll do it alphabetically.

TRUMAN notices that COOPER is starring at the white mask.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
She was beautiful.

COOPER nods his head for yes slightly and then looks at TRUMAN.

COOPER
She was the love of my life Harry.

COOPER returns to starring at the white mask.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP WHITE MASK

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the delicate white plaster mask of CAROLINE POWELL EARLE'S face lying on TRUMAN'S desk.




DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY

As the last scene of the CLOSE-UP on the white mask FADES OUT, we FADE IN to the next scene. Standing in the kitchen, PETE MARTELL talks to LUCY MORAN on the telephone.

PETE
Okay, okay Lucy.

MUSIC ENDS: QUESTION IN A WORLD OF BLUE (NO VOCALS)

PETE
Oh - oh - okay yeah, just - just tell Harry I’ll be right there okay, right.

PETE hangs up the phone. PETE briefly looks over his shoulder and smiles before he picks up two plates of food from the kitchen counter. PETE carries the plates over to the dining room table. Grinning, PETE quietly places one of the plates of food before his wife CATHERINE MARTELL.

We PAN RIGHT as PETE holds the other plate in front of ANDREW PACKARD, who is sitting across the table from his sister CATHERINE. ANDREW erupts into laughter as he sees the plate of food. PETE laughs along with ANDREW. With his white hair a mess and dressed in a robe, having just woken up, ANDREW holds the plate out so that CATHERINE can see it.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP PLATE OF FOOD

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the plate of food ANDREW is holding. The food on the plate is arranged to form a face: two eggs sunny side up with a drop of Tabasco for eyes, cut toast for ears, strips of bacon for a mouth and a single prune for a nose.

ANDREW (OFF SCREEN)
(goading CATHERINE) Huh - huh.


BACK TO SCENE:

CATHERINE is not amused one bit but PETE and ANDREW laugh hysterically. CATHERINE breaks it up by commanding …

CATHERINE
Peter, salt and pepper.

PETE
Comin’ right up Poodle.

PETE walks into the kitchen to fetch a salt and pepper shaker. ANDREW sets his plate down and starts eating. CATHERINE coldly looks over to ANDREW.

CATHERINE
You two bring out the worst in each other.

ANDREW
Oh Pete’s a prince of a man.

CATHERINE
Court jester.

PETE walks back to the table and sets a salt and pepper shaker on top of the table. PETE clasps his hands and announces …

PETE
Well, I got to mosey.

Jokingly, PETE reaches out as if to kiss ANDREW goodbye. ANDREW quickly responds by leaning back, juts his right elbow and growls at PETE. PETE throws out his left shoulder and arm as if to hit ANDREW. The two quickly turn to laughing a little.

PETE walks to the other side of the table, kisses his palm and pats CATHERINE'S chin. PETE walks to the front door, grabs his hat and coat and put his hat and coat on.

PETE
(grinning) Goodbye you sweet Packards.

PETE leaves.

CATHERINE quietly grabs a roll and cuts it with a knife.

ANDREW
Oh Catherine. Catherine I’d always have hope that time and age would mellow that tempest raging inside you.

CATHERINE
Watching you two act like the Hardy Boy’s always brings on stormy weather. What’s happening with Ghostwood?

ANDREW
I talked to the investors. The meeting is set. I leave for Paris tomorrow.

The front door opens.

ANDREW
Ah company.

Wearing a long sleeve plaid flannel jacket and jeans, JOSIE PACKARD steps inside holding a bundle of kindling sticks. JOSIE does not immediately notice ANDREW as she closes the door behind herself.

ANDREW
Dear Josie.

MUSIC: PACKARD THEME     31K

JOSIE stops dead in her tracks as she sees ANDREW, who she thought was dead. Shocked, JOSIE drops the bundle of kindling sticks.

ANDREW
I’m home! Did you miss me?

JOSIE faints and falls to the floor.

ANDREW
Oh she looked surprised.

CATHERINE, relishing the moment, boldly laughs.

CATHERINE
Poor Josie.

ANDREW
Oh she has her charms though.

CATHERINE
Yes, but not for long.

ANDREW erupts into a hard, gasping laughter.




CUT TO:

INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP on the edge of TRUMAN'S desk. We PAN UP. SHERIFF TRUMAN sits behind his desk reading a newspaper.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP NEWSPAPER

HANK JENNINGS, with the help of crutches, enters TRUMAN’S office. He is followed by DEPUTY TOMMY 'THE HAWK’ HILL.

HANK
Hi Harry.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Save it Hank.

HANK
What happened? (jokingly) Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning? So I broke parole, cry and eat liver.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You crossed the border into Canada. You consorted with drug dealers at Dead Dog Farm. You tried to kill somebody. I’m charging you with the attempted murder of Leo Johnson

HANK
Ouch. Well I think its safe to assume that I was at the diner the night that Leo was plugged, but you’re welcome to call ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I’ve got a witness that puts you at the scene with the gun in your hand.

HANK
Harry you obviously seem serious about this so I’m going to propose a trade. How about information leading to the arrest and conviction of Andrew Packard’s murderer. Hank Jennings' witness ...

HANK snaps his fingers.

HANK
... for the prosecution.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
No deals.

HANK
You’re telling me you’re more interested in the attempted murder of Leo Johnson, felon, then Andrew Packard? How’s that going to sit with your constituents?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You're through Hank.

HANK
My guess is Harry, not to well. Especially once they find out who pushed the button on Andrew and that you’re sleeping with her.

Teasingly, HANK makes a monkey sound, ‘Ooh-hoo ooh-hoo.’ SHERIFF TRUMAN is furious. Tight lipped, TRUMAN glances over to HAWK. HAWK senses his anger and takes it out on HANK by nonchalantly kicking away HANK’S left crutch. HANK falls face down on TRUMAN’S desk. HAWK pulls HANK up from the collar of his leather jacket.

HAWK
Gee, I’m sorry.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Get him out of here.

MUSIC: PACKARD THEME     31K

SHERIFF TRUMAN
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

HAWK picks up HANK'S left crutch off the ground and hands it to HANK.

HANK
I’ll get that.

HANK jerks the crutch away from HAWK. HANK and HAWK leave the room.

Hot headed, SHERIFF TRUMAN punches his right fist into the open palm of his left hand.

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - DAY

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of a clear plastic packet containing a bullet point that FBI SPECIAL AGENT ALBERT ROSENFIELD is holding.

ALBERT
This is the bullet we removed from you.

ALBERT holds into view another clear plastic packet containing a bullet point.

ALBERT
This is the one that was excavated from the dead man’s skull.

We ZOOM OUT. In the conference room of the building, DEPUTY COOPER stands next to AGENT ALBERT. ALBERT opens his metal briefcase, tosses the two packets inside and closes the briefcase.

ALBERT
Same bullets, same gun, same killer. Let’s go get her.

COOPER holds his right hand up to halt ALBERT.

COOPER
Albert hold your horses.

ALBERT
Coop, I appreciate any reluctance you might have for busting your pal’s old lady but the woman ventilated you and left you for dead.

COOPER
Albert, I don’t take it personally. What about the gloves, the powder tests?

ALBERT
News at five. Alright, fine you’re not mad but there’s an epidemic of multiple gunshot wounds following this chick around. She is a menace.

COOPER agrees and nods his head for yes.

COOPER
I’ll talk to her. Maybe she’ll confess, turn herself in.

ALBERT
(smartass) Maybe she’ll grow wings and join the circus.

ALBERT jerks his briefcase as he whips it off the conference tabletop and briskly leaves the room.

INT. THE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the beautiful legs of a WOMAN standing in the lobby of the hotel. We PAN UP. Dressed in a tan business suit, AUDREY HORNE stands in the lobby clutching a manila folder atop of which is a document she briefly glances over.

AUDREY walks up to the concierge desk where the concierge, RANDY ST. CROIX, is seated. RANDY stands up as AUDREY walks up to him and hands him a document.

AUDREY
Randy, I’ve got a list of all our non-repeat guests. We’re going to send them a special invitation to The Great Northern.

RANDY tosses the document to the desktop.

RANDY
Your enthusiasm brings a salty tear to the eye. However, I think you’ll find my job requires a little more than a tight sweater and a perky attitude.

AUDREY
Randy I’m learning the business, every week a different department, I don’t want your job.

RANDY hands AUDREY a nametag.

RANDY
Yes, I look forward to your stint in housekeeping.

RANDY picks up an envelope from the desktop and hands it to AUDREY.

RANDY
This came for you this morning. (somewhat rudely) Good luck Miss Horne. You’ll need it.

RANDY walks off.

Disheartened, AUDREY takes a seat behind the concierge desk and sorts her notebooks on the desktop. She then grabs the nametag and pins it on her suit lapel.

MUSIC: JOHN WHEELER’S THEME     50K

A customer, JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER, walks up to the concierge desk.

JOHN
Hi ya’. I just checked into room 215.

Occupied with a foul mood from her conversation with RANDY, AUDREY fiddles with her nametag. As she ignores the customer, AUDREY grumbles ...

AUDREY
Congratulations.

JOHN
Strange, they told me at the front desk that I should talk to you.

Still not having looked up and seen the customer, AUDREY rudely asks ...

AUDREY
Oh what is it I can do for you?

AUDREY finally looks up and is smitten by JOHN’S handsome looks.

JOHN
Sorry, I thought you were working.

JOHN starts to back off and walk away but AUDREY quickly answers.

AUDREY
I am working. I’m - I’m working. See?

AUDREY fiddles with some notebooks on her desk. JOHN returns to her desk.

JOHN
I see.

JOHN peers at her nametag.

JOHN
Audrey.

AUDREY looks down at her nametag and straightens it. John briefly studies AUDREY'S face and recognizes her.

JOHN
Horne?

AUDREY
At your service.

JOHN
I was wondering if you could send someone out to the airport. I’m traveling with some heavy equipment this trip and didn’t have enough room in the van.

AUDREY
What flight were you on?

AUDREY takes notes on a small black notepad.

JOHN
Uh my own. Uh I have a jet out there it shouldn’t be too hard to find.

AUDREY tilts her head in a saucy fashion.

AUDREY
Is there anything else I can do for you Mr. Rockefeller?

JOHN
Uh no thank you. (smiles) That’s funny.

He starts to walk away but quickly returns and answers.

JOHN
Yeah, I have a picture of you. You’re wearing a little durndurl??? skirt, you’ve got a white apron on you and you’ve got pigtails. Its unbelievably cute.

AUDREY
I don’t wear durndurl(???).

JOHN
You did then. It was right here ... at The Great Northern dining room.

JOHN closes his eyes.

JOHN
Close my eyes - I can almost see it. Little Audrey Horne ... (opens one eye and peers at AUDREY) as Heidi.

Slightly embarrassed, AUDREY peers down at her desk.

JOHN
Well anyway it was unforgettable.

As JOHN turns to walk away, he gazes back at AUDREY for a moment. AUDREY stares at her desktop as she recalls the memory JOHN revealed.

AUDREY
Heidi? I was ten.

AUDREY looks up and sees that JOHN has walked away.

AUDREY
Hey!

In the lobby, JOHN reaches down to the floor, picks up a brochure that an ELDERLY WOMAN has dropped and hands it to her. JOHN waves goodbye to AUDREY with a pair of gloves he holds in his left hand and walks off.

MUSIC ENDS: JOHN WHEELER’S THEME     50K

Disappointed, AUDREY returns her attention to her desktop. She finds the envelope RANDY handed her, rips off the short end's edge of the envelope, props it open and removes the letter from inside.

MUSIC: WINDOM EARLE’S THEME


INSERT: CLOSE-UP TORN LETTER

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the letter as AUDREY opens it to reveal that the letter is a torn segment. The torn letter has some handwriting in pencil.

BACK TO SCENE:

We FOCUS on AUDREY as she shakes her head slightly, unable to make sense of the torn letter. AUDREY reads a note card, that came with the torn letter, aloud.

AUDREY
Save the one you love. Please attend gathering of angels tonight at the Roadhouse 9:30.

BIG ED
Are you feeling poorly?

NADINE

NADINE walks away slightly and then stops with her back to BIG ED.

BIG ED

NADINE
Oh Eddie, we have to talk.

NADINE turns around to face BIG ED.

BIG ED
Okay.

NADINE
Mike and I are in love.

NADINE lowers her head. For a moment, BIG ED mulls it over.

BIG ED
In love?

NADINE
I hope you're not hurt. I wouldn’t want to hurt you for anything in the world. Honest, you have to believe that, but Mike and I, on that wrestling trip, we had the most magical night together.

NADINE brandishes a distant look with a joyful smile.

BIG ED
(nearly whispered) All night?

NADINE drops the smile and looks at BIG ED.

NADINE
Well you and Norma did it.

BIG ED
Well that’s fair. So, what’s this mean?

NADINE
Eddie, we have to call a spade a spade. We’re breaking up. Eddie, I’m so sorry.

NADINE moves to BIG ED arms and holds him close. Stunned, BIG ED stares over NADINE'S head, wide-eyed.

COOPER
Josie I want you to level with me about what happened in Seattle.

JOSIE
I told you. How many times do I have to say it. I escaped from Jonathan in airport and I don’t know what happened to him after that.

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of CATHERINE'S face as she listens in on the conversation between COOPER and JOSIE.

COOPER
You understand I could arrest you right now.

CATHERINE smiles in delight of that news. CATHERINE walks off.

COOPER
I came here as a friend of Harry’s. Now I don’t know what place he occupies in your heart, but I do know that you own his. I would think that you would like a chance to explain yourself to him.

JOSIE
Please go.

JOSIE stands up, with her back to COOPER.

COOPER
This is the end of it Josie, there are no other options. I want you at the station house by nine o’clock ... or I come and find you.

Still shaken, JOSIE breathes deeply.

CATHERINE
Dear, you look awful. Is everything alright?

JOSIE puts a hand on her chest and holds herself as she begins to tremble.

JOSIE
I don’t feel very well.

CATHERINE
Oh I’m sorry. I wish I had better news. I’ve spoken to Mr. Eckhardt again on your behalf, but he’s not entirely unsympathetic. He does insist on seeing you alone, tonight.

JOSIE
He’ll kill me.

CATHERINE
To tell you the truth, my biggest worry is what he’s going to do when he finds out that Andrew is alive. Won’t Mr. Eckhardt think that you’ve betrayed him, but of course you can tell him that you didn’t. After all, you did actually think that Andrew was dead.

JOSIE
I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t - know. Maybe you can help me? I think I’m going mad.

CATHERINE walks over to the nearby bookshelf.

CATHERINE
You will simply have to face Mr. Eckhardt, sooner or later. Tell him the truth.

JOSIE looks over to CATHERINE.

CATHERINE
Tell him whatever you want.

CATHERINE turns to the bookshelf and removes a book from the bookshelf. JOSIE peers into the cache revealed by CATHERINE. CATHERINE turns back to face JOSIE.

CATHERINE
Just pray that he leaves you.

CATHERINE turns back to the bookshelf and grabs a pair of keys from the cache.

CATHERINE
Oh there they are.

CATHERINE walks away from the bookshelf jiggling the keys as she passes by JOSIE, starring at her the whole while. CATHERINE walks up to the shutter wall/divider to the kitchen and pushes it open slightly. CATHERINE pauses to look back at JOSIE.

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of a telephone on top of BENJAMIN HORNE'S desk. We ZOOM OUT. BOBBY BRIGGS, dressed in office attire, is on the phone as he looks at a document in an open folder. BENJAMIN HORNE, dressed in a jogging suit and eating a stalk of celery, stands nearby. BOBBY returns the phone to its cradle and relays a message ...

BOBBY
Mr. Wheeler, he must be on his way?

BENJAMIN
Thanks Bobby. Why don’t you join us.

BOBBY tosses the folder to the desktop, picks up his suit jacket and puts it on.

BOBBY
Yeah?

BENJAMIN
Yeah.

BENJAMIN puts an arm around BOBBY and leads him to office entrance where JERRY HORNE and AUDREY are standing.

BENJAMIN
You know, board meetings are usually nothing more then the gathering of self minded individuals.

BEN removes his arm from around BOBBY.

BENJAMIN
Each more intent then the other on financial gain.

The four are now huddled together. JERRY offers his drink to his brother BEN.

BENJAMIN
No thanks.

JERRY holds a tray of hors d’oeuvres in his right hand. BOBBY reaches out to grab the tray and JERRY passes it on. As BOBBY scans over the hors d'oeuvres, JERRY points out one he should try.

BENJAMIN
But today, today is going to be something completely different.

The doors to the office open and JOHN WHEELER steps inside.

JOHN
Geez, am I late?

BENJAMIN
Ah.

BEN walks up to JOHN.

JOHN
Hot dog Benjamin.

BENJAMIN
John!

Happily reunited the two welcome each other with a big hug and a pat on the back.

BENJAMIN
You are a sight for sore eyes.

JOHN
Oh look who’s talking.

BENJAMIN
Oh, we’ve taken good care of you?

JOHN
The best.

JOHN looks over to AUDREY.

JOHN
My luggage arrived, thank you Audrey.

AUDREY quietly nods yes. JERRY is stuffing his face with hors d’oeuvres. BEN smiles and points at AUDREY.

BENJAMIN
Ah, you two have met?

AUDREY
Briefly.

BENJAMIN
John Justice Wheeler. Used to be in construction. Came up the hard way.

AUDREY
(slightly sarcastic) How nice.

JOHN feels the remark as he looks over to her.

BENJAMIN
You remember my brother Jerry of course.

Holding the tray of hors d’oeuvres in his right hand and his drink in the left, JERRY walks up to JOHN and offers him an hors d’oeuvre.

JOHN
I missed Jerry. How are you?

JERRY
Hi John.

JOHN grabs an hors d’oeuvre from the tray and holds it in his left hand.

BENJAMIN
And this is uh ... my executive assistant, Bob Briggs.

JOHN
Bob.

BOBBY
Hey what’s up.

JOHN and BOBBY shake hands.

JOHN
Pleasure.

BENJAMIN
Why don’t you all just take a seat.

JERRY, JOHN, AUDREY and BOBBY sit together on the couch in front of BEN'S desk. JOHN continues to hold his hors d’oeuvre in his left hand while JERRY munches away on the hors d’oeuvres on the tray.

BENJAMIN
I’ve uh ... I’ve asked Mr. Wheeler to join us on the board. Years ago I uh ... I made an investment in him. A pittance which he built into an empire.

BEN takes a seat next to his desk.

BENJAMIN
Now, I don’t take any credit but I believed in Jack even when he was a local boy pounding nails. I’ve asked him to return the favor and believe in me now.

JOHN
You're testing my well born modesty.

Unable to speak because his mouth is full, JERRY pats JOHN'S right shoulder and nods approval to him. BEN stands up and moves behind his desk.

BENJAMIN
Alright, suffice to say, Horne Industries Incorporated have fallen on hard times. The mill, the Ghostwood lands …

JOHN peers to his left where AUDREY is sitting and glances at her. He returns his attention to BEN.

BENJAMIN
… are now solely owned by Catherine Martell. I don’t begrudge her, the mill was and is after all her’s. So, in spite of these reversals and uh stripped of all …

AUDREY peers to her right and briefly glances at JOHN.

BENJAMIN
… the trappings of success, what are we left with? The human spirit.

MUSIC: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:27 - 3:48)

Puzzled, JERRY holds an odd expression as if frozen with a possible answer.

BENJAMIN
What is the greatest gift that one human being can give to another?

BOBBY holds a puzzled but disbelieving expression while AUDREY holds a puzzled but questioning expression.

BENJAMIN
The future. I give you ...

BEN throws the cover off of a large poster on an easel to reveal a black and white picture of a ferret.

BENJAMIN
... the little Pine Weasel.

BOBBY and AUDREY turn to look at each other, worried.

BENJAMIN
Found only in our tri-country area it is nearly extinct.

JERRY
They’re incredible roasted.

BEN clears his throat and points at the poster with his celery stalk as he speaks.

BENJAMIN
According to an environmental impact report, what few Pine Weasels remain will all be but wiped out by the Packard plans for Ghostwood development.

BOBBY
(disbelieving) So you want to uh ... save the weasel?

BEN sits down in a chair in front of the poster.

BENJAMIN
No Bobby, not just the weasel, but life as we know it. I want Twin Peaks to remain unspoiled in an era of vast environmental carnage.

JERRY
So we block Catherine’s development until the wheel turns and we get another shot. That’s brilliant Ben - that’s brilliant.

JERRY shakes his head slightly and laughs. JOHN looks at JERRY'S expression.

BENJAMIN
I plan to fight this Ghostwood development on every ground and with every available weapon.

BEN stands back up and points at the poster with his celery stalk.

BENJAMIN
The little Pine Weasel is about to become a household word.

BEN takes a bite from his celery stalk and walks over to the front of his desk.

AUDREY
Then what?

BENJAMIN
Then ... I am considering ... a run for the senate.

BEN takes another loud, crunchy bite from his celery stalk.

SHELLY
Thank you.

The ELDERLY CUSTOMER waves goodbye and quietly walks off. SHELLY picks up empty soft drink bottles as she walks back to the kitchen. As she does so, she passes WINDOM EARLE who is in a thin disguise as he eats at the island counter. NORMA JENNINGS is on the telephone at the back of the island counter near the service window. WINDOM pays his bill and tosses the tip in change on the counter. Before he quietly leaves, WINDOM leaves behind an envelope addressed to SHELLY JOHNSON.

NORMA
Annie its no problem really. I’ve got plenty of room. Just get on the next bus okay and I will be waiting. (reply) Oh honey don’t cry.

SHELLY returns from the kitchen carrying a large but shallow plastic bin. She stands next to NORMA.

NORMA
Its gonna be alright. I’ll see you soon. (reply) I love you too, bye.

SHELLY
So’s your sister coming?

NORMA
Tomorrow.

SHELLY and NORMA walk over to the area where WINDOM was sitting. They clean up the area by placing the dirty dishes into the bin.

SHELLY
God, what do you have to do to get out of a convent?

NORMA
(chuckle) You just leave, its not a prison.

SHELLY
(smiles brightly) Sounds like prison to me: no TV, no boyfriends.

NORMA
You know, when she was little I always used to think that Annie was from another place in time. I guess the convent’s been good for her in a way. Hard to imagine her out in the world.

NORMA spots an envelope on the counter next to the dirty plate.

NORMA
Oh look, there’s something for you.

NORMA hands the envelope to SHELLY.

SHELLY
Who from?

NORMA
I guess who ever was sitting there.

SHELLY rips the envelope open and pulls out a torn segment from a letter and a note card.

SHELLY
Hmm, look at this.

SHELLY
Mountains kiss; waves clasps; flowers, sunlight; the moon beams; is all this; thou not kiss. It doesn’t make sense.


BACK TO SCENE:

SHELLY casts a questioning gaze at NORMA. NORMA quietly looks over the torn segment in SHELLY'S hand. SHELLY reads the note card aloud.

SHELLY
Save the one you love. Please attend a gathering of the angels tonight at the Roadhouse 9:30.

NORMA
It sounds intriguing in a way but it sounds dangerous.

NORMA picks up the tip, left in change, off the counter.

SHELLY
I wonder who this is from.

SHELLY checks the torn segment, the note card and the envelope for a name

The bell at the front door rings as BIG ED walks into the diner. NORMA glows with a wide smile as she spots him. BIG ED walks into the island counter service area by opening the flip-up counter door, walks behind NORMA, twirls her around and caresses her in his arms.

BIG ED
Norma Jennings I’ve loved you every day for the past twenty years and I dream about you every night. Its time for us to be together. Will you marry me?

NORMA
(surprised) Ed?

BIG ED
You deserve it, to be happy. Its our turn babe.

BIG ED holds NORMA close as they passionately kiss.

SHELLY, standing nearby, quietly walks off to give them some privacy but not without checking out the kiss between the two as she sneaks a peak back at them.

Still wearing his disguise from the diner, WINDOM EARLE, wearing a baseball cap, dark blue sweater, jeans and a jacket, walks out of the cabin and up to LEO, singing ...

Mm-hmm. Just a few more and then we’ll eat. (recited dramatically) Fly to my breast, pierce me in colors. Otombno??? speak to me only of love.

WINDOM bends down to look LEO in the eye. LEO mindlessly continues to whittle on another stick of pine.

WINDOM
Leo you have an incomplete education. For instance, survival in the wilderness, ...

WINDOM stands back up.

WINDOM
... a relevant issue in your life my friend.

WINDOM reaches into his jacket pocket and fetches a metal arrowhead point.

WINDOM
Now this comes under the heading of practical instruction. Uh I hope you’ve been paying attention?

WINDOM
Nature is cruel. This is also a lesson.

WINDOM stares at the arrow point as he slowly spins the shaft in his hands.

NORMA moves closes to the bars at HANK'S cell.

NORMA

HANK
Well great ... now that you're here.

HANK feigns pain as he stands up and moves to NORMA.

NORMA
Hank I came here to ask you for a divorce.

HANK
Well uh first let me say I don’t blame you. You gave me a second chance and I blew it.

Recognizing his sweetened drivel, NORMA looks away.

HANK
I don’t know why I’m so self destructive, but I can see that that’s my priority in getting well. I’ve got a lot of work to do. In fact I’ve decided I’m going to try to go into therapy. I don’t want to be like this anymore.

NORMA
That’s very interesting Hank, but I have to get on with my life.

Gently, HANK reaches out and holds NORMA'S coat collar.

HANK
I know, I know you do. I just want you to be happy.

NORMA
Thank you.

HANK
I want you to do me one last favor. I want you to help me get out of here. If they send me back to prison I’ll die. I want you to tell the sheriff that I was at the restaurant the night Leo Johnson was shot. I was on my way home. I can’t prove it but you can.

NORMA
No more lies Hank.

HANK
Its not lying, its trying to save my life.

NORMA
No.

HANK
You’re killing me here Norma.

NORMA
Don’t blame this on me, don’t you dare!

HANK

NORMA looks away.

PETE
Now there are four or five different ways of doing this thing, and they all have their virtues.

A tray laden with a variety of donuts sits on the tabletop near the chessboard along with several coffee mugs and a speakerphone. PETE stands at the short end of the conference room table. DEPUTY COOPER is standing to the right of the table and SHERIFF TRUMAN stands on the opposite side of the table. In the background is a chalkboard with a map of the town drawn in chalk.

PETE
Uh I remember Capablanca and Lascer, St. Petersburg 1914, ...

Chomping on a donut, COOPER raises a finger to stop PETE'S babble.

COOPER

PETE
Yeah right.

PETE puts his coffee mug down on the table and slowly sits down in his chair as he looks over the chessboard. TRUMAN touches a switch on the speakerphone.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Get the Gazette on the phone. Tell them not to close out the personals. We need more time.

PETE
Okay.

PETE moves a chess piece on the chessboard, P to QN-3.

PETE
That’s it. Guaranteed to cause some sleepless nights.

COOPER
As long as he can’t remove another piece from the board.

TRUMAN bends down to look closely at the chessboard.

PETE
He can’t do it, not at least for five - six more moves.

COOPER finishes his donut and wipes his face with a hanky.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Maybe he’ll kill anyway, maybe just frustrate him.

COOPER neatly folds his hanky up and places it in his pants pocket.

COOPER
I don’t think so Harry. Earle has a perverse sense of honor about these things.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I never heard of a man who murdered by the rules.

Outside the conference room, COOPER and ALBERT walk up the hallway as they speak.

Seattle police have also come up with an eye witness who positively ID Josie leaving the car where they found the stiff. Now if you ain’t going to bust this bitch I would consider it a personal ...

COOPER stops ALBERT in the hall.

ANDREW raises his glass for a toast.

ANDREW

ANDREW takes a drink from his glass.

JOSIE
I ... am sorry Andrew.

JOSIE lowers her head.

ANDREW
I hated you at first of course. Perfectly normal response.

ANDREW takes a seat in a nearby chair in the room and sets his glass down on an adjoining table.

ANDREW
As my anger diminished I recalled that Eckhardt has a way of persuading people to do anything. It was his idea of course?

JOSIE kneels on the ground before ANDREW.

JOSIE
Yes, he made me do it, and he said you never loved me. You just married me to get back at him.

ANDREW
That’s not true, I did love you very much. Of course the same can not be said for you.

JOSIE motions forward for a reply but is cut short.

ANDREW
Please Josie, there will be no more lies between us. You had a job to do and you did it. Now you're paying the price. Every action has its consequence my dear. The police are closing in, if you don’t take action you’ll be sleeping in a jail cell tonight.

JOSIE shakes her head for no.

JOSIE
What can I do? Please help me.

ANDREW
You must see Eckhardt.

Again, JOSIE shakes her head for no.

ANDREW
Perhaps you were meant to be together all along. I’m sure he truly loves you. He doesn’t know I’m alive. He can get you out of this country.

Well it was wrong and I should have known that.

Put it down Josie.

JOSIE
(trembling) Ah ... Harry!?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
PUT IT DOWN!!!

JOSIE
Harry, forgive me. I never meant to hurt you.

In a nearly choking gasp, JOSIE holds the gun to her breast. She appears very distraught, pained, gasping for air.

JOSIE collapses to the bed. SHERIFF TRUMAN drops his gun, rushes to her, sits down on the bed beside her, picks her up and holds her close.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Josie?! Josie?

Mystified, COOPER lowers his gun and quietly looks on. TRUMAN looks at JOSIE'S face.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Josie?

TRUMAN looks up at COOPER.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
She’s dead.

For a moment, COOPER looks down at the ground in remorse. As COOPER looks back up, the image of TRUMAN holding JOSIE fades away and room becomes dark.

SOUND EFFECT: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING   2K

COOPER is having a vision. A spotlight brightens the room.

BOB
AAGGHHH!! AGHH!! AAGGHHH!!

BOB, the man with long grayish hair and wearing a jean jacket, slithers from underneath the bed and moves to kneel on the edge of the bed.

BOB
AGHH!! HAA - HAA!! COOP, WHAT HAPPENED TO JOSIE!! AAGGHHH!! AGHH!! AGHH!! AGHH!! HAA - HAA - HAA!! AAGGHHH!! AGHH!! HAA - HAA!!

BOB fades away.

MUSIC: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN

The LITTLE MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE, wearing a red suit, slowly materializes and dances in place on top of the bed to the music from COOPER'S dream. The LITTLE MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE fades away.

MUSIC ENDS: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN

SOUND EFFECT ENDS: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING     2K

The bright spotlight fades away and the room returns to normal as the vision comes to an end. The image of TRUMAN holding JOSIE returns.

COOPER blinks his eyes as he tries to comprehend what he just saw.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Oh god, Josie?

TRUMAN weeps over the loss of his love as he holds JOSIE in his arms.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Oh Josie? Oh god. Josie? Oh - ho, oh Josie.

FOCUSING on TRUMAN, we PAN RIGHT to the nightstand beside the bed and ZOOM IN on the drawer pull of the pine wood nightstand.

JOSIE'S face materializes on the knob of the drawer pull. JOSIE cries out, trapped within the confines of the wood. JOSIE'S face extends out of wooden knob, pushing the material outward as if it were plastic. JOSIE'S face turns and contorts as she shrieks and strains to get out.
