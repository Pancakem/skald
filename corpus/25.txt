INT. LOG LADY’S CABIN - DAY

MUSIC: CALL OF THE BLACK LODGE     272K

As she speaks directly to us, the ‘LOG LADY’ MARGARET LANTERMEN holds her wooden log in her arms like a baby. The LOG LADY sits with her back to the fireplace of her cabin and beside a table.

LOG LADY
Sometimes, well let’s say all times, things are changing. We are judged as human beings on how we treat our fellow human beings. How do you treat your fellow human beings? At night, just before sleep, as you lay by yourself in the dark, how do you feel about yourself? Are you proud of your behavior? Are you ashamed of your behavior? You know in your heart if you have hurt someone, you know. If you have hurt someone, don’t wait another day before making things right. The world could break apart with sadness in the meantime.

CLOSE ON: SHERIFF TRUMAN’S EYES

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN’S despondent eyes.

CLOSE ON: SHERIFF TRUMAN’S EYES

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of SHERIFF TRUMAN’S eyes as he looks up.


BACK TO SCENE:

DEPUTY TOMMY ‘THE HAWK’ HILL stands quietly in front of the table TRUMAN is sitting at. Dressed for duty, DEPUTY HAWK holds a plate with a metal cover over it in his right hand and a napkin with silverware in his left hand.

HAWK
One of Norma’s breakfasts, made special.

DEPUTY HAWK puts the plate down on the table in front of TRUMAN and takes the metal cover off to reveal: scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns and a small container of ketchup.

Sitting at a round table in a dark corner of the building, holding a shot glass with half a bottle of Jack Daniel’s whiskey close by, TRUMAN breaks into a soft joyous laughter.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
God bless Norma. Maybe later, maybe later. Thanks. How’s things at the ... station?

HAWK
Earle’s chess game is the big concern. The man has a poor sense of recreation.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah.

HAWK
We’re holding up, for now.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You and Cooper can handle it. It’s a pretty simple town, used to be. I guess ... the world’s just caught up to us.

HAWK flashes the secret sign of the Bookhouse Boys, an index finger dragged down the temple, and quietly leaves. TRUMAN grabs the whiskey bottle and fills the shot glass.

INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

MUSIC: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:26 - 3:48)

ANNIE BLACKBURNE, NORMA JENNINGS’S sister with long, wavy blonde hair and blue eyes, steps through the front door of the diner. Carrying a suitcase in one hand and her black purse hanging over her right shoulder, ANNIE, wearing a long black coat, a light-blue shirt and a long plaid skirt, walks into the diner looking for her sister. As ANNIE walks into the diner and heads towards the kitchen she passes MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS at the island counter.

NORMA smiles as she and SHELLY JOHNSON walk out from the kitchen and spot ANNIE.

NORMA
Annie.

NORMA walks up to ANNIE while SHELLY walks over to the short order window to pick up an order.

ANNIE
Hi.

NORMA
Hi.

NORMA and ANNIE hug. NORMA looks over to SHELLY.

NORMA
Shelly, this is my sister Annie.

Holding a plate with a slice of pie, SHELLY pauses in the service area of the island counter near NORMA and ANNIE for greetings.

SHELLY
Hi Annie, welcome. Norma’s told me all about you.

SHELLY walks off to deliver the slice of pie. ANNIE turns to NORMA.

ANNIE
(slightly worried) All about me?

NORMA
Well, Shelly’s like family.

ANNIE
With our family that’s not exactly a character reference.

Facing each other, NORMA and ANNIE take a seat at the island counter.

NORMA
How did you and mom get along?

ANNIE
Well, we can talk about her or feel good about things. I vote for plan B.

NORMA
Me too. I’m glad you’re here.

ANNIE
It feels a little strange.

ANNIE looks around the diner.

ANNIE
The real world. Little things like I’d almost forgotten how to use money. The closest we get in the convent was bingo chips.

ANNIE looks straight eyed at NORMA.

ANNIE
No charity Norma, promise.

NORMA
(smiles) Don’t worry, I’m going to work you till you drop.

ANNIE returns the smile.

We FOCUS on SHELLY as she fills out the bill for MAJOR BRIGGS. Having taken a bite of his pie and now sampling it, MAJOR BRIGGS looks up at SHELLY and critiques the pie.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Compelling.

SHELLY looks up from the bill pad she is writing on and with her eyes open wide, politely nods her head for yes. SHELLY rips the bill from the pad, puts the bill down on the counter and slightly rolls her eyes as she walks away.

MUSIC ENDS: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:26 - 3:48)

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:55)

As MAJOR BRIGGS eats his pie, the LOG LADY walks up besides him and notices the reddish-brown scar of three triangles joined at one point at the back of his neck behind his right ear.

SOUND EFFECT: SWOOPING AWARENESS     8K

The LOG LADY reaches out and touches the scar. MAJOR BRIGGS turns towards the LOG LADY and she takes a seat next to him on his right side. MAJOR BRIGGS holds an enigmatic expression as the LOG LADY puts her log on top of the counter and drapes her right arm over it.

CLOSE ON: COOPER’S FACE

As he reads, we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of DEPUTY DALE COOPER’S eyes perch over a document labeled ’Interpol.’ COOPER’S right eyebrow perks up.

MUSIC ENDS: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:55)


BACK TO SCENE:

Standing in front of TRUMAN’S desk, we FOCUS on HAWK.

HAWK
Harry’s about to hit bottom.

COOPER lowers the document.

COOPER
Is he eating?

HAWK nods his head for no. COOPER frowns as he closes the folder holding the document he had been reading. COOPER is wearing a plaid flannel long sleeve shirt and green khakis. A picture of a quarter waning moon sits on a shelf of the bookshelf behind COOPER.

COOPER
When do you think he’ll come back to work?

HAWK
I guess we’ll find out soon.

HAWK looks at the scattering of paperwork across TRUMAN’S desk.

HAWK
You need a hand?

COOPER
That’s a question I should be asking you.

HAWK
You’re the senior lawman Cooper. Let’s just let the rain fall as it has been. Besides, I hate paperwork.

COOPER looks over the scattered paperwork on the desktop.

COOPER
This is worse than the bureau with all this international documentation: Ekhardt, Josie.

COOPER grabs a manila folder from the pile of paperwork.

COOPER
This is the autopsy on her. Doc Hayward said he couldn’t determine cause of death.

COOPER hands the manila folder to HAWK. HAWK reaches out for it.

COOPER
The body only weighed 65 pounds.

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:30)

HAWK freezes his reach for the folder and looks directly at COOPER.

HAWK
How’s that possible?

COOPER pulls the folder back, marked ’AUTOPSY’ in big red letters, and glances over it before putting it down on the desktop.

COOPER
I don’t know. Maybe something to do with what I saw inside the room when she died.

HAWK
Maybe we better just whistle on our way past the graveyard.

COOPER
Yeah.

COOPER picks up his mug of coffee and takes a drink.

HAWK
Anything on Earle?

COOPER
Trail’s stone cold. Still waiting for his response.

We FOCUS down a deserted dirt road as a veil of sunlight filters down through the tall pine trees.




CUT TO:

EXT. EARLE’S CABIN - DAY

An establish shot. We FOCUS on an old, shoddy cabin used as a hideout by WINDOM EARLE. Smoke billows from the chimney of the cabin.




CUT TO:

INT. EARLE’S CABIN - DAY

Illuminating the slightly smoky interior, sunlight filters through the cracks of the warped boards of the cabin’s walls. Twirling a flower with white petals in the grip of his left hand, WINDOM EARLE sits in a sofa chair pinching his nose with his right hand as he practices his breathing exercises. LEO JOHNSON, wearing pajamas and a red robe, walks up to EARLE carrying a pair of slippers.

MUSIC: WINDOM EARLE’S THEME

LEO
(whispered) Slip.

WINDOM
Slippers.

Holding his breath, WINDOM points to the ground to show LEO where to put his slippers. LEO quietly complies and drops the slippers on the floor next to WINDOM’S feet. LEO wanders off.

MUSIC ENDS: JAPANESE FLUTE     53K

WINDOM
You know Leo, you can’t really appreciate how tonic country life is until you’re actually right here (deep breath) living it.

LEO returns and juts a smoking pipe in front of WINDOM’S face, surprising him.

WINDOM
Pipe, splendid.

WINDOM takes his pipe from LEO. LEO walks off. WINDOM puts the pipe in his mouth and blows on it.

WINDOM
Hmm.

WINDOM puts the pipe away in his shirt pocket and looks down at the flower he holds in his hands as he spins it in his fingertips by its stem.

WINDOM
Even if you’ve been to the country before, when you try to image what it would be like to go back the ... image is imperfect.

WINDOM pulls one of the petals off.

WINDOM
(slightly angry) The mental image is always imperfect.

WINDOM throws the petal away. LEO walks up to WINDOM holding a newspaper. WINDOM looks up at LEO.

WINDOM
Am I right?

Still holding the newspaper, LEO stands quietly looking down at WINDOM. WINDOM lowers his gaze to the flower and grins.

WINDOM
A passive agreement is acceptable Leo. Your silence speaks volumes.

WINDOM looks up at LEO.

WINDOM
Or if not volumes at least the occasional, punctuated paragraph, heh.

WINDOM puts the flower down.

WINDOM
Well, lets see what move our poor Cooper has come up with this time.

With the RUFFLING of newsprint, WINDOM rips the newspaper from LEO’S grip and opens the newspaper to the classifieds section. As WINDOM looks for the ad, LEO takes a seat next to WINDOM.

WINDOM
Uh-huh.

WINDOM finds the ad, reads the move, hastily folds the newspaper and holds on to it as he leans over to a nearby chessboard and moves a black pawn to queens-knight three. LEO stares at the chessboard.

WINDOM
(quickly realizes) This isn’t a move. This is a trick. He’s playing a stalemate game. Cooper doesn’t know the meaning of STALEMATE!

Furious, WINDOM swings the folded newspaper and whacks LEO hard. A distant SCREECH from an eagle bellows from outside the cabin.

WINDOM
He’s getting help.

WINDOM slams the folded newspaper to the ground and grabs his Japanese flute lying next to the chair. Holding the flute at its tip in his fist in his lap, WINDOM waves the flute in the air.

WINDOM
I can not tolerate people who do not play by the rules. People who shirk THE STANDARDS!

MUSIC ENDS: WINDOM EARLE’S THEME

Using the Japanese flute as a cudgel, WINDOM leashes out his anger by cracking LEO on the head and striking his chest. LEO winces in pain and shies away in fear but remains seated next to WINDOM. WINDOM returns to waving the flute from his lap.

WINDOM
Many people are going to regret this.

WINDOM takes a deep breath and shakes off his foul mood. WINDOM moves the flute to his lips and plays a tune.

MUSIC: JAPANESE FLUTE     53K


INSERT: CLOSE-UP RING

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of a ring on WINDOM’S left hand. The ring is made of three wound loops of gold wire with the outer loop twisting into three small loops to form a crown for the ring.

INT. TIMBER ROOM - DAY

We FOCUS on a gray carpeted floor and PAN UP on the legs of AUDREY HORNE, dressed in business attire with a gray skirt and her suit jacket draped over her right shoulder, as she gingerly walks up a constructed catwalk runway in the dining area of the hotel.

Two women, MODEL #1 and MODEL #2, watch AUDREY as she demonstrates the model’s catwalk on the runway.

MUSIC ENDS: JAPANESE FLUTE     53K

AUDREY
Got it?

MODEL #1, a tall, shapely blonde, and MODEL #2, a short redhead, look at each other and roll their eyes. A BUSBOY works in the background folding up tablecloths.

MUSIC: BIG ED AND NORMA’S SONG     38K

We FAVOR ON the suave RICHARD ‘DICK’ TREMAYNE and PAN RIGHT around the models as he walks up and around the two models holding a long gold, feminine cigarette holder.

DICK
Ladies, may I say, you’re both ... delightfully ... represent ...

DICK looks at MODEL #1 chest and smiles.

DICK
... the sanctity ... of nature.

We FOCUS on DICK as he stands next to MODEL #1.

DICK
(offers) Cigarette?

MODEL #1
I prefer to keep my chest clear.

DICK looks at down MODEL #1 chest and smiles.

DICK
Ahh, the great god, fitness.

MODEL #1
Hmm.

MODEL #1 grabs MODEL #2’S arm to lead her away. As they walk off they roll their eyes once more.

Several WORKERS are at work in the Timber Room: adjusting the lighting and moving tables and chairs.

AUDREY walks up to DICK, who is still starring at the MODELS.

AUDREY
Have you spoken to Pinkle?

DICK
What’s a Pinkle?

DICK turns to face AUDREY.

AUDREY
He’s giving a talk on the Pine Weasel.

DICK gives a questioning gaze.

AUDREY
The endangered animal.

In the background, MR. TIM PINKLE slowly makes his way towards DICK and AUDREY.

DICK
Ohh, lovely. What is it, a raccoon or something?

AUDREY
A ferret.

Holding a stuffed model of a ferret, MR. PINKLE walks up to AUDREY.

MR. PINKLE
Audrey.

AUDREY
Ah great. You two should coordinate.

DICK
You are dreaming.

DICK rolls his eyes and walks away. Puzzled, MR. PINKLE follows after DICK. AUDREY opens her day planner and takes a note. Occupied with her day planner, AUDREY turns around and nearly walks into JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER, who is standing nearby watching the commotion in the Timber Room.

JOHN
Hello. Its like you’re trying to run lumber upstream.

MUSIC: AUDREY’S DANCE

AUDREY
Now how can I help you Mr. Wheeler?

JOHN
Horne, about the talk we had at dinner.

AUDREY
Gosh I’m sorry. I was rude wasn’t I?

JOHN and AUDREY nervously ramble over each other’s words.

JOHN
(concurrent) It was my fault entirely. I .. I’d ... Who am I to waltz in here out of nowhere. Except your father insisted I come and ...

AUDREY
(concurrent) Its just that when it comes to my family I get a little excitable that all. But we need help. Anyone can see that.

JOHN stops and listens to AUDREY.

AUDREY
And I can’t think of anyone better qualified for the job than you.

AUDREY looks up at JOHN. Nervousness aside, JOHN smiles and starts over.

JOHN
Hello?

AUDREY
What were we talking about anyway?

JOHN
Well I was apologizing and you were apologizing. We were both really sorry about something. You wanna’ go out somewhere?

AUDREY quietly stares into JOHN’S eyes.

JOHN
Bad time, its not good.

AUDREY
(waxes enthusiastic) Oh no - no, its great.

JOHN
How about a picnic?

AUDREY
Uh ... uhm ... we need outdoor stuff: a basket, blanket.

JOHN
Food.

AUDREY looses her smile.

AUDREY
Uh ... I don’t know how to cook.

JOHN
I betcha’ someone in the kitchen does.

AUDREY smiles brightly.

We FOCUS on DICK and MR. PINKLE, still holding the ferret model, as they walk past WORKERS rearranging the interior of the Timber Room.

MR. PINKLE
This is just to show people what the Pine Weasel looks like.

DICK
I understand the concept perfectly, Mr. Dinkle.

MR. PINKLE
Pinkle, the name is Pinkle.

DICK stops and turns around to face MR. PINKLE. In the background, two WORKERS haul a totem pole.

DICK
Well what I’m trying to make clear is that using a stuffed animal to represent an endangered species as an ecological protest constitutes the supreme incongruity.

DICK smiles and walks away.

MR. PINKLE
Well, that’s clear Dick.

MR. PINKLE rushes off to catch up with DICK.

Deeply depressed, SHERIFF TRUMAN sits quietly slouched in his chair at a round table in a dark corner of the building.

COOPER
Harry.

TRUMAN sits up.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hey Coop.

TRUMAN takes a sip from his shot glass.

COOPER
We got Josie’s dossier in from Interpol.

TRUMAN nods his head from side-to-side.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Not interested.

COOPER
In addition to killing Ekhardt, trying to kill me and killing Jonathan in Seattle.

TRUMAN again nods his head from side-to-side.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Closed cases.

COOPER
She’s also warranted for a variety of felonies in Hong Kong.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I don’t need to hear this.

TRUMAN reaches out for the whiskey bottle to refill his shot glass.

COOPER
She’s also had two prostitution arrests, Harry.

About to refill his glass, TRUMAN freezes. A wave of inward anger flashes as TRUMAN grips the bottle and the glass hard but it passes quietly.

COOPER
Harry, eventually its going to help to know that she was a hardened criminal, a killer.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Get out of here.

COOPER
I know its not easy right now.

TRUMAN looks up COOPER.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Just get out of here. GET OUT OF HERE, GO!!!

INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY

CATHERINE MARTELL sits at a desk flipping through large blueprint plans of the future Ghostwood Estates. An architectural rendering of Ghostwood Estates sits in the background on the bookshelf. We ZOOM IN to a CLOSE-UP on the profile of CATHERINE, who slowly turns her head to the side.

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME (0:00 - 0:55)    

JONES, a woman dressed in a black dress carrying a large black leather purse on her left shoulder, stands quietly a short distance from CATHERINE’S desk.

JONES
The door was open.

CATHERINE
(cold) A country habit. We’re all so trusting.

JONES
My name is Jones. I was the executive assistant to late Mr. Ekhardt.

CATHERINE nudges her head to the side and looks at a nearby chair - a gesture for JONES to approach and take a seat.

JONES
Thank you.

As JONES moves to the chair, her eyes never leave CATHERINE’S gaze. CATHERINE slowly slips her hands below the desktop, out of sight. Wearing a thin smile, JONES sits down in the chair in front of CATHERINE’S desk and sets her black bag on her lap.

JONES
I’ve come to expedite the transport of his body back to Hong Kong.

CATHERINE sits quietly.

JONES
Tragic what happened. You know, he really did love Josie.

CATHERINE
Didn’t we all.

JONES
They’re going to be buried side-by-side.

CATHERINE
(eyebrows perked) So they can keep an eye on each other.

JONES
I guess you have your reasons to be bitter.

CATHERINE
Oh just call me a healthy skeptic.

CATHERINE raises her right hand from below the desktop holding a revolver pointed at JONES.

CATHERINE
Now why did you really come to see me?

JONES
I came here to give you a gift. May I?

JONES starts to open her bag but stops as CATHERINE quickly remarks.

CATHERINE
I don’t think so.

JONES freezes. Unblinking, CATHERINE orders.

CATHERINE
Slowly.

Without loosing eye contact with CATHERINE, JONES lifts a strap on the bag aside, reaches inside the bag, pulls out a glossy black box (roughly 8 inches by 12 inches in size) and places it on top of CATHERINE’S desk.

JONES
From Thomas.

Still holding the revolver trained on JONES, CATHERINE sweeps her gaze across the black box.

JONES
I have a few things to tidy up and then I’ll be leaving tonight. (smiling, ominous) Good luck Mrs. Martell.

Emotionless, CATHERINE gazes at JONES. JONES slowly gets up from her chair and leaves. CATHERINE turns her head to see JONES leave but quickly returns her attention to the mysterious black box.

INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY

Wearing a blue top and black skirt, DONNA HAYWARD opens the front door to the house to reveal WINDOM EARLE in disguise: a grayed moustache, grayed hair, a suit coat and a hat.

WINDOM
(politely) Uhm excuse me, I - I’m looking for Bill or Eileen Hayward?

DONNA
Well their not here right now. Can I help you?

WINDOM
Well I - I’m Dr. Gerald Craig, uh ... an old friend of - of Will’s from medical school and uh ... well see I - I have a convention in Spokane. So I just thought I’d swing by and surprise them. Uh ... which daughter are you?

A little embarrassed, DONNA cracks a smile.

DONNA
Oh, Donna.

WINDOM
Donna.

DONNA
Would you like to come in Dr. Craig?

WINDOM nods his head for yes.

WINDOM
I - I’d appreciate that.

WINDOM removes his hat as he walks inside the house.

MUSIC: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:38 - 3:48)

DONNA closes the front door and follows WINDOM into the living room. Standing by the sofa in the living room, WINDOM looks around the house. With her hands clutched behind her back, DONNA stands a few paces behind WINDOM.

DONNA
Can I get you something to drink Dr. Craig? A pop or something?

WINDOM turns around to face DONNA.

WINDOM
Uh ... thank you no, no.

WINDOM looks down at the coffee table where a newspaper lies. An open bottle of Coke-Cola, with a straw in it, and a slice of pie on a plate are also on the coffee table.

WINDOM
Uh ... (nervous laugh) is this your local paper?

WINDOM bends over towards the coffee table and puts his hat down as he picks up the paper.

DONNA
Yeah, pretty small town huh.

WINDOM briefly looks at the front page of the newspaper.

WINDOM
Now don’t knock small towns until you’ve lived in the city.

WINDOM looks around the house.

WINDOM
Donna, you know ... it seems like Will has found himself a piece of heaven here.

WINDOM tosses the newspaper onto the coffee table and takes a seat on the couch.

WINDOM
Now, don’t you have two sisters?

DONNA
Yeah, they’re younger than me.

WINDOM
Are they both as beautiful as you?

Still standing, DONNA chuckles in embarrassment.

DONNA
Well, I don’t know.

DONNA takes a seat on the couch.

WINDOM
You know, your dad and I, we used to sit around and try to figure how our lives would work out.

WINDOM looks around the room.

WINDOM
Well it seems like he’s come a little closer to the mark then I have.

WINDOM looks at DONNA.

WINDOM
You’re in high school?

DONNA
Unfortunately.

WINDOM
Ha - ha, I felt exactly the same way. You know, high school is - is difficult, you know, you have no idea what you want to do with your life so it seems that absolutely none of it applies to your life.

In agreement, DONNA nods her head for yes.

DONNA
You’re right.

WINDOM
Well ... well don’t worry. It’ll all work out. For now you just enjoy it in all its absurdity.

DONNA nods her head.

DONNA
Okay.

WINDOM pulls out a small 4 inch by 3 inch black box tied closed with a white string with a note card attached.

DONNA
Sure.

WINDOM
You know speaking of school, Will and I graduated 30 years ago this month. So I’d ...

WINDOM removes the note card from the black box and hands the black box to DONNA.

WINDOM
... just a small remembrance for him. Well I should be on my way.

WINDOM grabs his hat from the coffee table and puts his hat on as he stands up. DONNA also stands up.

WINDOM
Uhm ...

WINDOM hands the note card to DONNA.

WINDOM
... oh - oh this is the number where I’m staying. I hope to see you ... later, Donna.

DONNA
Me too.

WINDOM walks away towards the door. DONNA looks down at the small black box and slides the note card under the tie strings. DONNA watches WINDOM as he lets himself out.

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of a portable card table that is covered with several different chess sets in play. PETE moves up from underneath the table to a kneeling position and looks down at a chess set, studying it. PETE picks up a white pawn, moves it, picks up a nearby note pad and takes a few notes. PETE briefly scans the chessboard before he ducks down and crawls over to another card table.

We PAN RIGHT over several chess sets to FOCUS on PETE as he surfaces from below the table. PETE perches over another chess set and briefly studies it before moving a white pawn.

PETE picks up a book about chess strategy.

PETE
I mean, the classic Earpsman, ...


BACK TO SCENE:

We FOCUS on a WIDE-SHOT of the reception area. PETE and COOPER kneel on the ground face-to-face on opposite sides of a card table with several chess sets between them. Several portable card tables, topped with chess sets, are scattered in the reception area. A poster of a chessboard hangs on the wall and several boxes of chess sets are scattered in the area.

PETE
... you wind up with six pieces. Now I can improve on that but even if I get there in half the time and wind up with twelve ... that means ... six people die.


CLOSE ON: COOPER’S FACE

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME    

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of COOPER’S face.

COOPER
Do your best Pete. Windom Earle’s genius carries with it the vice of impatience. He doesn’t want pawns he wants royalty. Protect those, particularly the queen. Then we can frustrate him.

ANDY
You don’t have to do the little hook thing, that’s optional.

It’s a privilege. No one else gets to make that move.

ANDY
Okay Mr. Martell.

MAJOR BRIGGS and the LOG LADY sit in two chairs facing the chalkboard. The LOG LADY holds her log in her arms. Several chess sets are scattered on the conference room table.

MAJOR BRIGGS

COOPER
(to the LOG LADY) And you noticed it today?

LOG LADY
My log noticed, I remember.

COOPER
What do you remember Margaret?

LOG LADY
Look at the back of my leg.

The LOG LADY shifts in her seat to show COOPER the back of her right leg. COOPER walks up to the LOG LADY and looks at a scar on the back of her leg just below the knee. Perplexed, COOPER returns to the chalkboard to draw an image of the scar.

MUSIC ENDS: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:30)

MUSIC: THE MILL FIRE     16K

To the left of the sketch of the three triangles, COOPER draws the image of the LOG LADY’S scar, a simple drawing of two mountain peaks that mirror each other.

LOG LADY
I was seven years old. I went walking up in the woods and when I got back I was told that I had disappeared for a day. All I could recall was a flash of light and that mark was on my leg.

MAJOR BRIGGS speaks animatedly by waving his left hand.

MAJOR BRIGGS
We all three recall the light.

LOG LADY
And also ... the call of the owl.

COOPER
Yes, I remember.

LOG LADY
The only other time I ... I saw that sign and heard that sound was right before my husband died ... in a fire.

COOPER stands quietly next to the chalkboard with the two sketches. MAJOR BRIGGS and the LOG LADY stare at the two sketches. COOPER turns to face the sketches on the chalkboard. MAJOR BRIGGS points at the chalkboard.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I’m connecting with something.

LOG LADY
Yes.

COOPER
What?

LOG LADY
I don’t know.

The LOG LADY looks down at her log and pets it. MAJOR BRIGGS and COOPER continue to stare at the sketches.

AUDREY
Ah, no one’s ever sung a song to me before.

JOHN
You must have been serenaded at least once or twice?

AUDREY chortles.

AUDREY
I don’t inspire much singing. Most boys are afraid.

JOHN
Well they don’t know you then, not really.

AUDREY
I don’t think anybody really knows me.

JOHN
Sounds like a warning.

AUDREY
I know.

JOHN
Look, if there’s another guy.

AUDREY
Ssshh. There was someone but ... not anymore. There’s nobody.

JOHN
So what do you want to do now?

JOHN grins.

AUDREY
Do you know any more cowboy tricks?

JOHN smiles.

JOHN
If you have a lariat in that picnic basket I could lasso passing cattle.

AUDREY chortles.

AUDREY
I don’t think there’s a cow for miles.

JOHN
Stray dogs? Raccoons? Birds? ... (wide-eyed) Weasels?

AUDREY laughs.

We view a WIDE-SHOT of the area. As the day draws to a close, the sun casts an orange glow. Near the shore of the lake, AUDREY and JOHN sit on a checkered picnic blanket with a picnic basket of food next to them. In the lake, ducks swim by and QUACK. AUDREY reaches into the picnic basket, pulls out a green apple and holds it out for JOHN to take a bite. JOHN takes a bite and struggles slightly to bite through the apple. JOHN reaches out to support the apple but is able to chomp through.

DONNA
You had a visitor.

DR. HAYWARD
Who’s that?

DR. HAYWARD puts the bag of groceries down on the dining room table.

DONNA
Somebody you went to medical school with named Gerald Craig.

DR. HAYWARD
Gerald Craig?

DR. HAYWARD gives a puzzled look to EILEEN and then turns back to DONNA.

DR. HAYWARD
That’s not possible Donna.

MUSIC: WINDOM EARLE’S THEME

DONNA
Well yeah, he said he was on his way to a convention in Spokane. He knew everything about me.

Puzzled, DR. HAYWARD and EILEEN look at each other.

DONNA
Here’s his number and this.

DONNA hands DR. HAYWARD the small black box and the note card WINDOM gave her. DR. HAYWARD opens the note card and briefly reads it before passing it to EILEEN. EILEEN picks up the phone and dials the phone number on the card.

DR. HAYWARD
Gerald Craig was my roommate. He drowned on a rafting trip on the Snake River. I was there Donna, I tried to save him.

DONNA
Well then?

DR. HAYWARD removes the white string from the small black box. Baffled by the response on the telephone, EILEEN remarks ...

EILEEN
It’s a cemetery.

DR. HAYWARD opens the small black box.

BIG ED
Nadine uh ... what I’m here to say to you is uh ... uh seeing how you’re with Mike now ...

NADINE smiles.

NADINE
Its so cute the way you get embarrassed.

BIG ED
And uh ... since I have now found someone else ... Nadine I’m not sure you’re going to understand this.

NADINE
Of course I understand Eddie. This isn’t just a little spat.

DR. JACOBY leans over to NADINE.

DR. JACOBY
Nadine uhm ... do you know what Ed is suggesting?

NADINE
Its not too obvious. We’re not like talking relativity here. We’re breaking up. Major, final breakup.

DR. JACOBY
Well ... yes, technically I guess it - it is a breakup but uh ...

BIG ED
Well it’s a little more than that Nadine.

Uncomfortable, BIG ED stares at DR. JACOBY.

NADINE
Ed, you are so serious. These are the dating years. You’re acting like it some really big deal.

BIG ED wrings his hands together.

BIG ED
Doc?

DR. JACOBY leans close to BIG ED.

DR. JACOBY
Ed, there are no secrets tricks or magic words. It - its like the dissolving of - of scar tissue around a wound. She’ll start to see reality again when her mind begins to feel safe.

BIG ED
Well when will that be?

DR. JACOBY
Well I can’t say. That tissue’s packed in there pretty hard.

BIG ED and DR. JACOBY turn to NADINE as she speaks.

NADINE
Okay, well one thing I really don’t want to see Ed. Are any incidents with Mike. No jealous rages. Well, maybe just one.

NADINE smirks with a smile but quickly looses the smirk as her eyes start to widen. BIG ED looks at DR. JACOBY.

BIG ED
I give up.

DR. JACOBY
Nadine, you and Ed are about to get a divorce.

NADINE raises her left hand and puts it in front of her left eye, the eye with the black patch over it.

NADINE
I think I’ve gone blind in my left eye.

NADINE lowers her hand and blinks her right eye. Disconcerted, BIG ED and DR. JACOBY look at each other.

INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

MUSIC: COUNTRY #5

We PAN UP from the floor of the island counter service area. Sitting at the island counter bar, NORMA smiles as she reads her mail. The letter NORMA is reading is an announcement for the Miss Twin Peaks pageant. NORMA turns the letter around so that the ad faces her.

NORMA
Shelly?

SHELLY stands bent over near the short order window as she fills out an order on her tab.

SHELLY
Yeah.

SHELLY walks over to NORMA.

NORMA
Have you seen this?

NORMA turns the letter around to show SHELLY. SHELLY reads the heading out loud.

SHELLY
Miss Twin Peaks.

NORMA’S eye’s brighten and she gestures to the letter by shaking the letter. NORMA wants SHELLY to take an interest in the pageant. SHELLY throws her head back as she scoffs at the ad.

SHELLY
Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me?

NORMA
There’s a cash prize and a scholarship. And I bet you could walk away with it.

NORMA folds the letter up. SHELLY shakes her head for no and rolls her eyes.

SHELLY
I don’t think so.

NORMA
Its easy, you give a speech, you answer a few questions.

SHELLY picks up a nearby spoon and holds it to her mouth like a microphone.

SHELLY
(wide-eyed, bold) Miss Double R Diner, what would you do to bring about world peace?

SHELLY smiles and thrusts the spoon/microphone towards NORMA as if to record her remark. SHELLY returns the spoon/microphone to her mouth and playfully speaks in a higher tone of voice.

SHELLY
Well, I would bring all the world leaders together, make them form a circle and join hands. Cause you can’t make a fist holding hands.

SHELLY cocks her head to the side and smiles.

NORMA
You’re a shoo-in.

SHELLY
I have an order up.

SHELLY clicks her heels as she walks away to pick up a plate at the short order window. After picking up the plate, SHELLY continues to joke around about the pageant by holding her hands up, palms up and sashay across the floor. Enjoying the prank, NORMA smiles at her the whole time.

SHELLY walks up the island counter service area on the opposite side of the counter where NORMA is seated. WINDOM EARLE sits at the counter disguised as a biker: black t-shirt, black bandana on his head, one black fingerless glove on his right hand and a long haired wig.

SHELLY
Here’s your burger.

SHELLY puts a plate with a hamburger and fries down on the counter in front of WINDOM. WINDOM holds his mug of coffee near his mouth, cupped in both hands.

WINDOM
What’s with the dance?

SHELLY
Oh - uh, my boss told me I should enter a pageant, Miss Twin Peaks.

WINDOM
Now you can kid about it but uh ...

WINDOM points at SHELLY.

WINDOM
... you are very pretty. I think you should enter.

SHELLY
Thanks but I don’t think of myself as pretty.

WINDOM gestures to his chest.

WINDOM
That’s an inner thing, you know.

SHELLY smiles politely and then quietly walks off. WINDOM watches SHELLY walk off as he holds his mug of coffee close to his face. The front door to the diner RINGS, as some enters the building. WINDOM shifts his gaze from SHELLY to the person entering the diner.

Through WINDOM’S POV, COOPER, holding his attention on the book he is carrying, walks up to the island counter bar and takes a seat right across from WINDOM on the opposite side of the island counter bar. COOPER opens his book, about Tibet, to a bookmark, puts the bookmark aside and starts to read.


BACK TO SCENE:

Behind the island counter, ANNIE, dressed in one of the diner’s blue waitress uniforms, walks up to COOPER.

ANNIE
Would you like something to drink?

COOPER looks up from his book and is immediately smitten at the sight of ANNIE.

COOPER
Yes, I’d like a ... cup of deep black joe please.

ANNIE
Coming right up.

ANNIE bends down and fetches a saucer with a coffee cup from a shelf below the counter. ANNIE puts the saucer with the inverted coffee cup on the counter next to COOPER. COOPER and ANNIE both reach out to turn the coffee cup right side up. ANNIE stops short of picking the cup up and looks at COOPER. COOPER smiles and pulls his hand back. ANNIE reaches out, picks up the cup and turns it right side up.

ANNIE bends down to fetch some utensils from the shelf under the counter. COOPER nervously fidgets his left arm as looks up at ANNIE, to the coffee cup and then back at ANNIE as she stands up.

COOPER
You must be Norma’s sister.

ANNIE stops and looks at COOPER.

ANNIE
I’m Annie. How’d you know?

COOPER extends his right hand out to shake hands with ANNIE.

COOPER
Dale Cooper, local law enforcement.

ANNIE shakes hands with COOPER.

ANNIE
Must keep you pretty busy.

COOPER
Sure does.

For a second there is an awkward moment of silence. COOPER interrupts before ANNIE walks off to get the pot of coffee.

COOPER
Are you uh ... staying in town for awhile?

ANNIE
I might be here quite awhile.

TRUMAN wavers in his chair.

COOPER
Well Harry it’s a little complicated at the moment.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That’s the good thing about the law it DOES’T BREATH YOU CAN’T KILL IT!

COOPER walks closer to TRUMAN.

COOPER
Harry, I’ve got an idea. Why don’t you hand me that gun.

TRUMAN laughs and waves his revolver into the air.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I don’t believe I’ve ever handed my gun over TO ANYBODY IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!

COOPER walks closer to TRUMAN and leans on an antique cabinet with a vinyl record player.

COOPER

A huge banner, ’Stop Ghostwood: Save the Pine Weasel’, is draped in the background. Several large black and white posters of the pine weasel adorn the walls. A totem pole is decorated with small flashing white lights. We FAVOR ON BEN as we PAN RIGHT. The room is packed with people.

BENJAMIN
... I would like to thank all you for this uh ... marvelous turnout. Its very gratifying to see so many people who are ... sincere about their environment.

With a flash from a bulb, a PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a photograph of BEN.

MUSIC: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:26 - 3:48)

BENJAMIN
The stop Ghostwood campaign is a determined effort to keep the rapid development interests from trying to turn our beautiful Northwest forest into a monstrous amusement park. Destroying animal preserves which have been undisturbed for centuries. The little worlds of ... served as sanctums for several endangered species. Not the least of which is the little pine weasel.

BEN turns to point at the poster of the pine weasel.

BENJAMIN
Before moving along, I would just like to remind all of us that ecology is not a luxury science. It is not about pleasant appearances. It is about survival.

But not to uh ... understate the value of visual pleasure, we come to ...

Some feedback interference comes from the speaker as BEN picks up the microphone stand and moves it back to the curtain that divides the catwalk from the backstage.

BENJAMIN
... the fashion show. Now if any of you think you recognize some of the models its because they are concerned members of the community who have graciously given of their time tonight. So ladies and gentlemen to kick things off, here is our host Richard Tremayne.

BEN and the crowd CLAP their hands. DICK walks out from behind the curtain and up to the microphone and bumps into BEN as he walks away from the microphone to head off behind the curtain. DICK adjusts the height of the microphone.

DICK
Oops. Thank you, splendid gathering.

A PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a photograph of DICK.

DICK
Our little Lucy is wearing a delightful mix ...

DICK pauses as LUCY steps out from behind the curtain. LUCY walks up the catwalk.

DICK
... of warm Northern comfort and Southern insouciance. An elegant worsted wool jacket over a plethora of plaid.

At the end of the catwalk, LUCY spins around and around in place. A PHOTOGRAPHER snaps her picture.

DICK
With a hint of polka-dot.

LUCY stops spinning and wavers slightly under the loss of balance from spinning. LUCY walks down the catwalk towards the curtain.

DICK
That’s fabulous isn’t it. A moonless night black, slim skirt for the look that always says, Hey world, I’m here.

Facing the audience, LUCY stands posed at the curtain. Finished, DICK motions LUCY to move along. LUCY raises her hand, sets a pose and then slips behind the curtain.

DICK
Mr. Brennan is wearing a fire engine red ...

ANDY steps out from behind the curtain and walks, rather stiffly, up the catwalk starring bug-eyed at the audience.

DICK
... turtle neck beneath an all plaid Pendleton shirt. He completes this look with his red and black buffalo check jumpers. For the man who wants to make a statement while retaining that casual feel whether he’s out mastering a task or riding the breeze of a chance meeting.

ANDY remains standing at the end of the catwalk starring at the crowd.

DICK
That’s it Andy.

ANDY turns around and walks down the catwalk towards the curtain. The audience CLAP their hands. ANDY pauses at the curtain and, with a blank expression, turns to DICK. DICK gestures with a head nod to the curtain for ANDY to leave. ANDY shakes his head and then walks behind the curtain.

We FOCUS on AUDREY and MODEL #3 in the area back stage. MODEL #3, already dressed for the catwalk, adjusts her hair in a mirror. AUDREY helps the MODEL with her hair as she speaks to her.

AUDREY
At this rate we’re running late so if we could all sort of hurry Richard along with some quick movin’ out there.

MODEL #3 stands up and heads for the catwalk. Another model, MODEL #4, takes a seat at the mirror.

We FAVOR ON LUCY and PAN RIGHT as she walks into the back stage area.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
I’m hot in this thing.

LUCY
You’re hot? I’m dressed like a sheep, all this wool.

ANDY walks behind LUCY and follows her to the door out of the Timber Room.

LUCY
And I think Mr. Tremayne is getting more than a little hot with all these girls.

We FOCUS on AUDREY as MODEL #4 gets up from the chair and heads off to the catwalk.

AUDREY
Go, go - go - go.

Another MODEL takes a seat in the chair in front of the mirror.

We FOCUS on BEN standing near the corner of the bar in the Timber Room as he dunks a cookie into a glass of milk. CATHERINE MARTELL walks up to the bar and takes a seat on a stool behind BEN.

CATHERINE
Well if it isn’t John York, friend of the redwoods.

BEN turns around to see CATHERINE.

BENJAMIN
Catherine, how good of you to come.

BEN eats his cookie.

CATHERINE
Ben darling who you kidding with all this?

BENJAMIN
I am absolutely, one-hundred percent sincere.

CATHERINE
Oh come on, look who you’re talking to. We’re in the same line of work. You’ve always been a little more obvious but this?

BENJAMIN
Catherine, have you ever in your entire life had an experience that truly changed you?

BEN takes a sip from his glass of milk.

CATHERINE
Please, spare me the born again sales pitch and level with me. You can’t help to stop my development plans so what do you actually expect to gain from all this?

BEN grins.

BENJAMIN
A first scrubbing ... on one of the dirtiest consciences in the entire Northwest. And hopefully, it will happen to you.

BEN removes his glasses and bends close to CATHERINE.

BENJAMIN
(softly) Catherine, I know what your plans for Ghostwood are and granted I used to see life exactly the way you do and no matter how many deals I make or how much money I make, inside I was still a black, miserable clod of dirt. I am finding that the one thing that really affords you joy in life, the only authentic thing is giving. Don’t wait until you’re on your deathbed to find that out.

CATHERINE
God help you. You actually sound like you mean it.

BENJAMIN
I do, for you, for me, the future. Catherine, why don’t you take this opportunity to transcend a lifetime of megalomania and egocentricity and write us a big, fat check to help stop Ghostwood.

CATHERINE boldly laughs. BEN joins CATHERINE’S laughter with a chuckle of his own. BEN walks around CATHERINE, kisses her cheek and walks away. CATHERINE is puzzled.

DICK awaits MR. PINKLE’S entrance from the curtain door but MR. PINKLE walks up to DICK from the corner of the stage carrying a metal cage.

MR. PINKLE
Thank you kids. Thank you, thank you.

MR. PINKLE puts the cage down on the floor and, smiling brightly, moves to the microphone.

MR. PINKLE
Well hi, how’s everything goin’?


MR. PINKLE POV:

Through MR. PINKLE’S POV, the audience remains quiet.


BACK TO SCENE:

MR. PINKLE
That’s good. Uhm ladies and gentlemen, I have with me a little fella’ who doesn’t understand the peril that awaits him. (dramatic) An innocent in a world gone mad. A world ...

DICK throws his left shoulder forward and nudges MR. PINKLE’S back to move on. MR. PINKLE gets the message and skips the growing dramatic presentation.

MR. PINKLE
... gone mad. And without further adieu, ladies and gentlemen, I - I give you the endangered pine weasel.

MR. PINKLE bends down to the metal cage on the floor, opens it and pulls out a live pine weasel. MR. PINKLE stands back up and shows the pine weasel to the audience.

MR. PINKLE
Now this species is of the weasel family and not only is he non-aggressive to us humans and has beau-ti-ful fur ...

MR. PINKLE strokes the fur on the back of the pine weasel.

MR. PINKLE
... but also he is by nature an excellent controller of rodents. Unfortunately this little friendly fella’ is incredibly curious making him very easy for one to trap.

The pine weasel worms its way to face a large white campaign button pinned on DICK’S lapel. MR. PINKLE follows the pine weasel’s attention to the button.

MR. PINKLE
He is also attracted to bright, shiny objects.

The pine weasel worms its way to face the buttons of DICK’S shirt.

DICK
Must - must be my - my studs.

The pine weasel continues to wiggle its way in MR. PINKLE’S grasp to move to DICK’S chin.

MR. PINKLE
Yeah, oh ... and also, it is amazing, he is particularly attracted to various smells like, believe it or not, very cheap cologne.

MR. PINKLE follows the pine weasel’s attention to DICK’S face.

MR. PINKLE
Oh, what’s this - what’s ... I think he want to give you a kiss Dick.

DICK
Oh please Mr. Pinkle.

MR. PINKLE
Come on, come on.

DICK looks towards the audience and smiles.


DICK’S POV:

Through DICKS’ POV, the audience quietly sits.


BACK TO SCENE:

MR. PINKLE
Its alright give him a kiss.

DICK
A kiss?

MR. PINKLE moves the pine weasel closer to DICK’S face. A bit weary, DICK leans back and stretches his left hand out near the pine weasel as if to grasp it.

MR. PINKLE
Oh come on. Atta boy.

DICK
Hello there little pilgrim.

MUSIC ENDS: FRESHLY SQUEEZED

MUSIC: A???

The pine weasel BITES DICK on the nose. DICK SHOUTS and arches backward.

DICK
AHHH!!!

The pine weasel slips out of MR. PINKLE’S grasp as it remains clamped to DICK’S nose.

MR. PINKLE
No ... no ...

With the pine weasel clamped to his nose, DICK runs up the catwalk SHOUTING in pain. MR. PINKLE follows DICK, trying to recapture the pine weasel.

MR. PINKLE
No ... no ...

DICK pulls the pine weasel off the end of his nose and throws it down into the audience. The pine weasel lands on someone’s dinner plate. The PATRONS at that table panic, turn the table over as they rush to stand up and run away from the loose weasel. The pine weasel lands on the floor.

MUSIC ENDS: A???

MUSIC: B???

EVERYONE panics, stands up and runs around the room. Holding his nose, DICK runs backstage. A few people from the audience follow DICK backstage.

MR. PINKLE
Don’t panic. He’s completely harmless. He’s already endangered.


PINE WEASEL’S POV:

Through the pine weasel’s POV we get a jostled view close to the ground. People’s feet can be seen as they rush about the room.


BACK TO SCENE:

Amid people running by, the pine weasel scampers along the floor.


PINE WEASEL’S POV:

Through the pine weasel’s POV we bounce along the floor and come upon a PATRON, who is scared, lying flat on the floor.

PATRON #1
Oh no, ahhh!


BACK TO SCENE:

ANDY and LUCY walk out from backstage and up the catwalk.

ANDY
Don’t - don’t panic anybody. Just don’t panic.

People continue to run around the room. Part of the structure holding up the curtain falls as people rush backstage. AUDREY rushes from backstage and up to the microphone near the catwalk.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
Nobody panic.

AUDREY
Everyone, calm down. Stay in your seat.

A MODEL, screaming in hysteria, rushes past the partially fallen curtain and knocks AUDREY off the catwalk platform. JOHN WHEELER catches AUDREY in his arms.

JOHN
You alright?

Stunned, AUDREY stares into JOHN’S eyes.

AUDREY
Fine.

JOHN
A lot of fuss over a loose weasel.

AUDREY
Maybe we should help?

JOHN
I don’t know, looks like it might do this crowd some good.

AUDREY
Did - did you come for the fashion show?

JOHN
No, I came for you.

Carrying AUDREY in his arms, JOHN and AUDREY kiss amidst the confusion in the room.


CLOSE ON: MODEL

Standing at the end of the catwalk, the MODEL SCREAMS at the top of her lungs in hysteria.

MUSIC ENDS: B???

INT. THE BOOKHOUSE - NIGHT

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME    


JONES’S POV:

Through JONES’S POV, the door to the room opens and we step inside. With his back to the door, a BOOKHOUSE BOY sits in a nearby chair reading a book. We quietly move closer and closer to the BOOKHOUSE BOY. JONES throws her left hand down hard on the side of the neck of the BOOKHOUSE BOY. The BOOKHOUSE BOY is knocked out cold, unconscious.

We move beside the bed where SHERIFF TRUMAN is sleeping. JONES puts a handgun down on a nearby table.


BACK TO SCENE:

JONES stands beside SHERIFF TRUMAN’S bed and removes a black scarf draped over her head. JONES unbuttons her black blouse and removes it to reveal a black silk slip. Next, JONES unbuttons and removes her skirt and removes a clip that bunches her hair at the back of her neck. JONES lifts the covers on the bed and slips into bed.
