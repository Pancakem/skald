MUSIC: CALL OF THE BLACK LODGE     272K

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, ‘LOG LADY’ MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.

LOG LADY
As above, so below. The human being finds himself, or herself, in the middle. There is as much space outside the human, proportionately, as inside. Stars, moons and planets remind us of protons, neutrons and electrons. Is there a bigger being walking with all the stars within? Does our thinking affect what goes on outside us and what goes on inside us? I think it does. Where does creamed corn figure into the workings of the universe? What really is creamed corn? Is it a symbol for something else?

INT. TIMBER ROOM - DAY

SONG: BARBER SHOP QUARTET

In the dining area of the Great Northern Hotel, FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER and AGENT ALBERT ROSENFIELD are having breakfast. In the background is a barber shop quartet singing. The dining area is rather busy.

COOPER
Buddhist tradition first came to the land of snow in the fifth century AD. The first Tibetan king to be touched by the Dharma was King Hathatha Rignamputsan. He and succeeding kings were collectively known as the Happy Generations. Now some historians place them in the Water Snake Year, 213 AD. Others in the year of the water ox 173 AD. Amazing isn’t it? The Happy Generations.

COOPER eats his breakfast.

ALBERT
Agent Cooper, I am thrilled to pieces that the Dharma came to King Ho-Ho-Ho, I really am, but right now I’m trying hard to focus on the more immediate problems of our own century right here in Twin Peaks.

COOPER
Albert, you’d be surprised at the connection between the two.

ALBERT
(sarcastic) Color me amazed.

COOPER
Ronette Pulaski has woken from her coma.

ALBERT
And?

COOPER
I’m thinking she’s gonna have quite a story to tell when she regains the ability to speak.

ALBERT
So she’s not talking?

COOPER
Waking but silence, probably shock. I’m going to show her the sketches of Leo Johnson and Bob, the man Sarah Palmer saw in her vision. The man who came to me in my dream.

ALBERT
Has anyone seen Bob on Earth in the last few weeks?

COOPER
No, not yet.

ALBERT grabs a nearby folder on the table and opens it.

ALBERT
Okay, I uh performed the autopsy on Jacques Renault. Stomach contents revealed ... lets see: beer cans, a Maryland license plate, half a bicycle tire, a goat and a small wooden puppet, goes by the name of Pinocchio.

ALBERT puts the folder aside. COOPER turn to him, smiles and says ...

COOPER
You’re making a joke.

ALBERT
I like to think of myself as one of the Happy Generations.

ALBERT smirks.

ALBERT
And by the way, the fat boy wasn’t strangled. Killer snuffed him with a pillow, he was wearing gloves. Tape used to bind his wrists was stolen from the hospital supply closet and that is it. If Jacques has any secrets he’ll be taking them underground.

COOPER
What about the mill?

ALBERT
Well, preliminary suggests arson. I nominate Leo Johnson.

COOPER
We’ll have to get a statement from Shelly Johnson.

ALBERT
Hospital says she’s well enough.

ALBERT looks at COOPER.

ALBERT
How do you feel?

COOPER
Me?

ALBERT
I believe it’s customary to ask after the health of one recently plugged three times.

COOPER
Thanks for asking.

ALBERT turns away.

ALBERT
Don’t get sentimental.

COOPER
Who shot me, Albert?

ALBERT looks around the room.

ALBERT
My men are interrogating the hotel guests, the usual bumper crop of rural know-nothings and drunken fly-fishermen. Nothing so far. Oh, the world’s most decrepit room service waiter remembers nothing out of the ordinary about the night in question, no surprise there. Señor Droolcup has, shall we say, a mind that wanders?

COOPER raises his right hand.

COOPER
Albert, my ring is gone. One day here ... the next day gone.

ALBERT
So?

COOPER
I’m glad you’re with us Albert. We need the very best.

ALBERT
Dedication to duty wasn’t the only thing that brought me back here Cooper.

COOPER
What else?

ALBERT
Windom Earle.

COOPER looks at ALBERT.

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:35 - 1:00) (NO SAX)

COOPER
Agent Earle? He’s retired.

ALBERT
Yeah, to a nice comfy chair complete with wrist restraints at the local laughing academy.

COOPER looks away.

COOPER
What happened?

ALBERT
Nobody knows. Your former partner flew the coop, Coop. He escaped, vanished into thin air.

COOPER
That’s not good.

We PAN LEFT from the table COOPER and ALBERT are seated at. We PAN two other tables until we FOCUS at a table where JONATHAN KUMAGAI sits. Peering over a newspaper, JONATHAN looks across the room at COOPER and ALBERT.

DONNA gestures to a stack of newspapers that are piled right next to the bed.

MRS. TREMOND
Yes, that’s fine.

DONNA sets the tray down on the stack of newspapers and takes a seat on the nearby sofa, positioned alongside the left wall. DONNA doesn’t notice the GRANDSON. MRS. TREMOND starts to cough, a long hacking cough. DONNA quietly watches MRS. TREMOND move a tissue to her mouth as her cough subsides.

GRANDSON
Miss.

Spooked, DONNA turns her head to see a young boy sitting in a chair, wearing a tuxedo.

DONNA
Oh, hi.

GRANDSON
Sometimes things can happen just like this.

The GRANDSON snaps his fingers. MRS. TREMOND takes the cover off of her dish.

Cream corn!? Do you see cream corn on that plate?

Facing MRS. TREMOND, DONNA glimpses down at the plate.

Okay, Mrs. Tremond. I’ll be back tomorrow to pick this up and to bring your lunch.

DONNA starts to walk off but stops and turns to MRS. TREMOND as she adds ...

MRS. TREMOND
They used to bring me hospital food, that Jeanette.

DONNA politely listens and then heads out again. MRS. TREMOND calls to DONNA once more.

MRS. TREMOND
Young lady.

DONNA turns toward MRS. TREMOND.

MRS. TREMOND
You might ask Mr. Smith next door.

MRS. TREMOND gestures to a nearby apartment.

DONNA
Mr. Smith?

DONNA points at the apartment for verification and MRS. TREMOND nods her head for yes.

MRS. TREMOND
He was Laura’s friend.

DONNA turns to the GRANDSON as he suddenly speaks.

GRANDSON
J’ai une ame solitaire.

DONNA ruminates over the GRANDSON’S statement.

MRS. TREMOND

DONNA mulls over the information then turns around and leaves. MRS. TREMOND and her GRANDSON look at each other.

Positioned behind and to the right of RONETTE, SHERIFF TRUMAN opens and holds the door for AGENT COOPER as he enters the room.

COOPER
Thanks, Harry.

COOPER and TRUMAN grab a stool from the corner of the room near the doorway. COOPER and TRUMAN roll the stools next to RONETTE’S bedside. The wheels on the stools roll NOISILY as the stools are moved.

COOPER
(greeting) Ronette.

With the stools alongside RONETTE’S bed, COOPER tries to sit on it but he and TRUMAN realize that the seat on the stools are too high. COOPER and TRUMAN both attempt to lower the seat. SHERIFF TRUMAN spins the top of the seat to try to screw it down. COOPER looks for a lever to push or pull to lower the seat.

COOPER
I can’t get this thing to work.

COOPER continues to look for a way to lower the seat. COOPER looks over to RONETTE.

COOPER
Excuse us, Ronette.

TRUMAN bends down and finds preliminary instructions on the stool support. TRUMAN reads the instructions outloud for COOPER, who is having a hard time bending down due to his injuries.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Stop. Read operating instructions beneath seat before using.

TRUMAN looks under the seat. COOPER listens on. TRUMAN finds the instructions and reads them outloud.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Stand next to chair or stool. Do not remain seated. Place foot on base and pull seat all the way up until you hear a click.

COOPER follows the directions as TRUMAN reads them. As COOPER pulls the seat all the way up he slightly strains himself and lets out a slight GRUNT. COOPER looks at RONETTE.

COOPER
Sorry Ronette.

COOPER and TRUMAN successfully lower the seats on their stools. COOPER and TRUMAN sit down. COOPER leans to RONETTE.

COOPER
Ronette, can you hear me?

As a response, RONETTE blinks her eyes once.

COOPER
Okay, I’m glad you’re feeling better. I don’t want to upset you but we need your help. I’m going to show you some sketches. We need to know if you’ve seen these men before. We need to know if these are the men that hurt you, okay.

Again as a response, RONETTE blinks her eyes once. COOPER unrolls a sketch he brought.

COOPER
Do you recognize this man?

MUSIC: WALKING IN THE DARK (SLOW VARIANT)

COOPER holds the sketch in front on RONETTE.

COOPER
Is this the man that hurt you?

RONETTE grabs the sketch and moves it closer to get a better view.


RONETTE’S POV:

From RONETTE’S POV we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the sketch as it slowly comes into focus. The sketch is a charcoal sketch of LEO JOHNSON.


BACK TO SCENE:

RONETTE shakes her head for no, the sketch is not the man that hurt her. COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN look at each other. COOPER grabs another sketch.

COOPER
Ronette.

COOPER holds a second sketch up for RONETTE to inspect. RONETTE slowly moves to grab the sketch and moves it closer to her face.


RONETTE’S POV:

From RONETTE’S POV we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the sketch as it slowly comes into focus. The sketch is a charcoal sketch of the madman known as BOB, the man seen wearing a jean jacket and having long gray dirty hair.

RONETTE
Uhh train uhh uhh train uhhm uh train uhh train, train.

COOPER
Ronette?

SHERIFF TRUMAN rushes to the door. COOPER stands up and leans over to RONETTE.

RONETTE
(gasping) Uhh train, train, train.

TRUMAN calls out into the hall.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Nurse! Right away!

COOPER
Train? Are you in the train car? Train car?

RONETTE
Train, train, train, train, train, train! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

COOPER
Okay, okay stay calm.

A NURSE runs into the room and up to RONETTE’S side.

RONETTE
Train, train.

RONETTE smashes a nearby light. In the dark, RONETTE continues to mumble and squirm.

CUT TO:

INT. BENJAMIN HORNE’S OFFICE - DAY

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of two green books vertically propped open on the floor with the binding up. We PAN UP to JERRY HORNE who is squatting on the floor near the books. JERRY holds a smoked cheese, in the shape of a pig, clenched in both hands along with a knife in his right hand. JERRY savoringly looks over the smoked cheese pig.

JERRY
Brother Ben, we’ve got two ledgers and one smoked cheese pig. Which one do we burn?

We FOCUS on a WIDE-SHOT of the office, BENJAMIN HORNE, holding a cigar, sits next to JERRY on the floor. Behind BEN and JERRY is a small fire in the fireplace. JERRY turns to BEN.

JERRY
And it ain’t gonna be my pig.

JERRY starts to naw on his cheese pig. BEN taps his index finger on the green ledger closest to him.

BENJAMIN
The real ledger shows the mill slowly seeking into bankruptcy, masterminded by Catherine. The one she faked, for public consumption, shows the mill turning a healthy profit.

JERRY
So which one do we burn?

JERRY returns to chewing on his cheese pig.

BENJAMIN
Catherine’s dead. We put all of our money on Josie. Catherine takes the fall for the fire. Josie profits the insurance money, sells us the mill and the land and ... nah, wait a minute.

BEN snaps his fingers.

BENJAMIN
First she has to get dear Pete to sign on the dotted line.

JERRY
Why does Pete have to sign?

BENJAMIN
Andrew’s will calls for Catherine or her heirs to approve of any sale.

JERRY
So which one do we burn?

JERRY returns to eating his cheese pig.

BENJAMIN
Once Josie sells us the mill we could get a better price if it appears to be more profitable.

JERRY
So we burn the real one.

BENJAMIN
On the other hand, the real one would hold up under any future scrutiny.

JERRY
Depending upon on how one looks at the situation it appears ... they both have merit.

BENJAMIN
I know.

BEN looks at JERRY.

BENJAMIN
Maybe we should burn both of them.

Smiling, JERRY looks at BEN.

JERRY
(amused tone) It looks like we are one hundred percent certain that we’re not sure.

BENJAMIN
Jer, obviously something requires burning ... and since we don’t want to set fire to your smoked ... cheese ... pig.

BEN stands up, pats his brother on the back and moves to his desk.

BENJAMIN
Why don’t we uh ...

BEN opens a drawer of his desk.

BENJAMIN
... try these?

BEN lifts up a bag of ...

JERRY
(excited) Marshmallows! Ben, where are those hickory sticks?!

CUT TO:

INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN is sitting on the floor beside the front door of the diner. ANDY fumbles with some scotch tape that he has managed to get tangled and pieced all around his hands and fingers. ANDY struggles to remove the tape but can’t. A piece of scotch tape has even managed to wind up on his head. One of the sheriff’s "Have you seen this man" wanted posters with the sketch of BOB is tapped on the door.

MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS sits with a mug of coffee at the island counter. Hearing all the tape ruffling, MAJOR BRIGGS turns around to look at ANDY.

We FOCUS on ANDY as he struggle to remove the scotch tape from his fingers and hands.

MAJOR BRIGGS turns around once more and briefly looks at ANDY. MAJOR BRIGGS returns back to his coffee and takes a sip.

We FOCUS on ANDY as he struggles to remove the scotch tape from his fingers and hands.

MAJOR BRIGGS turns around again and look at ANDY, trying to see exactly what is going on.

Having not improved his situation at all, we FOCUS on ANDY as he struggle to remove the scotch tape. ANDY is interrupted as someone walks up to the door. ANDY moves aside slightly and stares at the person as they enter the building.

MAJOR BRIGGS stares at his coffee mug. The person that entered the diner is the LOG LADY, carrying her log and chewing pitch gum, and she takes a seat to the left of MAJOR BRIGGS. NORMA JENNINGS, standing behind the island counter, walks up to the LOG LADY with a coffee mug and a pot of coffee.

NORMA
Margaret, it’s always very nice to see you.

NORMA pours the LOG LADY a cup of coffee.

NORMA
But if you’re going to spit your sticky pitch gum out in the diner, would you please use an ash tray and not the counter or the booth like you did last time.

The LOG LADY stops chewing and stares at NORMA. The LOG LADY swallows her gum.

LOG LADY
I’ll have a bear claw.

NORMA walks off. The LOG LADY turns to MAJOR BRIGGS and looks him over.

LOG LADY
You wear shiny objects on your chest.

MAJOR BRIGGS looks down at his chest.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Yes I do.

LOG LADY
Are you proud?

MAJOR BRIGGS
No, achievement is its own reward. Pride obscures it.

For the LOG LADY’S coffee, MAJOR BRIGGS points to a canister of ...

MAJOR BRIGGS
Cream?

The LOG LADY shies away, places a hand over her coffee mug and slides it close to herself. MAJOR BRIGGS takes a sip from his coffee mug. The LOG LADY places her hand back on her log and turns to MAJOR BRIGGS.

LOG LADY
My log has something to tell you. Do you know it?

MAJOR BRIGGS
(puzzled) I don’t believe we’ve been introduced.

LOG LADY
(scornfully) I do not introduce the Log. Can you hear it?

MAJOR BRIGGS looks at the log.

MAJOR BRIGGS
No, ma’am. I cannot.

LOG LADY
I will translate.

The LOG LADY turns to her log.

LOG LADY
Deliver the message.

The LOG LADY looks at MAJOR BRIGGS.

LOG LADY
Do you understand?

MAJOR BRIGGS nods his head.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Yes, ma’am. As a matter of fact I do.

MAJOR BRIGGS ponders over the message. MAJOR BRIGGS peers over to the LOG LADY, who now quietly chews on some pitch gum. MAJOR BRIGGS thinks it over some more then peers over to the LOG LADY again.

LUCY works at her desk in the reception office. A fly buzzes around and distracts her attention. LUCY’S eyes track the fly as it buzzes around her office.

Just outside the front double doors of the building, ANDY paces back and forth.

Sitting still, LUCY watches the fly land. LUCY slowly gets up to try and kill it but it starts to buzz around her office again. LUCY sits back down and tracks it.

We FOCUS on ANDY as he continues to pace just outside the front double doors of the building.

LUCY tracks the fly as it buzzes around her office. Holding a pencil in her hand LUCY watches the fly land and flings the pencil at, killing it.

ANDY enters the building and walks up to the reception office window. ANDY still has a piece of scotch tape in his hair. At the window, ANDY sees LUCY bent over as she looks for her pencil. ANDY nervously looks away. LUCY sits back up and immediately notices the scotch tape in ANDY’S hair. ANDY slides open the plexiglass window to LUCY’S office.

LUCY
(coldly and formally) No messages, Deputy Brennan.

LUCY closes the window. ANDY opens it again.

ANDY
Listen to me, Lucy Moran. You just listen. The Tacoma Sperm Bank was looking for donors, naturally I applied. It’s my civic duty and I like whales. A routine physical examination revealed that I’m sterile. Sure, I thought it meant I didn’t have to take a bath but the doctors told me the truth. They told me I can’t have babies. So what I want to know now is why you’re having one and how?

LUCY stares at ANDY, then she stands up and slowly leans forward to him. ANDY assumes a kiss, so he leans forward, closes his eyes and puckers his lips. But LUCY quickly reaches out with her right hand and pulls the scotch tape from ANDY’S hair. LUCY quickly closes the window and takes a seat. Confused and disappointed, ANDY walks off. LUCY now struggles to remove the scotch tape from her hands.

HANK
(uncaring) Hmm ... might of.

HANK gestures to deer head trophy.

HANK
You know that’s an awfully cute buck, Harry.

HANK laughs. SHERIFF TRUMAN goes through some of his files on his desk.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Let’s not waste our time.

HANK
Okay.

TRUMAN opens a folder, checks it over and then tosses it on his desk next to HANK.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Why don’t you ... just sign in like a good boy? Keep your nose clean for another week.

HANK sternly looks at TRUMAN. HANK looks at COOPER and then grabs a pen. HANK smiles and chuckles slightly as he signs with an ‘H’ and a period. HANK closes the folder and chuckles again. Before he exits HANK turns to COOPER.

HANK
It’s really nice to see you again.

Straight faced, COOPER looks at HANK. HANK exits and shuts the door behind himself. SHERIFF TRUMAN grabs the folder and looks it over.

COOPER
Interesting piece of work.

TRUMAN closes the folder.

COOPER
How long were you and Hank friends?

TRUMAN throws the folder to his desktop.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We grew up together. Hank used to be a Bookhouse Boy. Back then, Hank was one of the best of us.

Wearing sunglasses, JERRY enters the open double doors of the office flapping a sheet of paper in his hand like a flying bird. JERRY walks up to the desk and checks the document one last time. BENJAMIN sits behind the desk with a glass of wine in his right hand.

JERRY
One insurance policy, unsigned.

BENJAMIN
Un?

JERRY tosses the document onto BEN’S desk.

JERRY
The agent said that Catherine was concerned about certain irregularities, such as Josie being named chief beneficiary.

BEN looks at the document.

BENJAMIN
Agent wasn’t supposed to show it to her.

JERRY
Well, considering Catherine’s ... smoky fate, for our side ... it’s all for the best.

BENJAMIN
Well, win a few lose a few. Let’s get those pickled icemen on the blower.

JERRY walks around the desk to the phone and dials a number. LELAND PALMER marches confidently through the open double doors of the office and walks up to BEN’S desk.

LELAND
Gentlemen, I’ve been giving this a lot of thought. This mill fire will no doubt put contract signing on hold for the moment. So we must ensure that the moment, our moment, does not pass us by.

On the phone, JERRY gestures to LELAND to keep it down.

LELAND
I therefore recommend that we make a quick but cordial follow up phone call to Iceland. Do a little gentle handling. Let Einar know that we’re right on top of this thing.

JERRY hands the phone to BEN and somewhat scornfully tells LELAND ...

JERRY
We can handle that.

BEN scornfully looks at LELAND.

BENJAMIN
Ben Horne for Einar Thornson.

LELAND
(surprised; elated) Oh, now this is a coincidence.

JERRY leans down towards the phone and tries to listen to the conversation.

BENJAMIN
Blis blis Einar! (reply) What’s that?

BEN gestures to JERRY to move closer and listen.

BENJAMIN
Where did you hear about it?

BEN and JERRY scornfully look at LELAND.

BENJAMIN
Mr. Palmer called to tell you about the fire?

Smiling, LELAND nods his head for yes and points to himself. JERRY shakes his head in disappointment at LELAND.

BENJAMIN
No, no I wouldn’t call it a disaster at all. It’s just uh just one on those things, an unfortunate development. But I assure you, Einar, that in no way will it affect our development plans.

JERRY grabs the phone from BEN. BEN scornfully looks at LELAND. LELAND nods an understanding of his actions.

JERRY
Jerry Horne here Einar, kor die blesser. Full speed ahead! Eh, eh.

BENJAMIN grabs the phone from JERRY.

BENJAMIN
Yes, yes of course Einar. We will fax all pertinent details to you. (reply) Yes, yes I promise.

LELAND nods his head to show his agreement.

Excuse me?

LELAND
My grandfather’s summer house on Pearl Lakes. He lived right next door. I was just a little boy. (stressing each word) But I know him. I have to tell the sheriff about this right away.

LELAND walks out of the office with the flyer. BEN and JERRY, hunched over the desk beside each other, stare into the office where LELAND was standing.

BENJAMIN
Jerry, please kill Leland.

JERRY
Is this real Ben ... or some strange and twisted dream?

LEO JOHNSON lies unconscious in a hospital bed, connected to a life-support system which has tubes running to his mouth and sensors on his chest. SHELLY JOHNSON, wearing a robe over her hospital gown, stands a distance away from LEO’S bed. DR. WILL HAYWARD explains LEO’S situation to SHELLY.

DR. HAYWARD
The bullet lodged in Leo’s spine ...

DR. HAYWARD notices SHELLY standing a distance away from LEO. DR. HAYWARD persuades SHELLY to come closer.

DR. HAYWARD
It’s alright Shelly, come on.

SHELLY moves besides the foot of the bed. DR. HAYWARD stands at the head of the bed. Between DR. HAYWARD and SHELLY is a mirror that reflects the image of LEO’S face.

DR. HAYWARD
The bullet lodged in his spine but we removed it successfully. As for possible paralysis it’s too early to tell. Leo lost a lot of blood, most of it before we had a chance to operate. I fear the resulting oxygen deprivation starved his brain, induced the coma you see here.

SHELLY
Is he a vegetable?

SHELLY looks at DR. HAYWARD.

SHELLY
Is he in pain?

DR. HAYWARD
He’s not in pain. Beyond that it’s hard to say.

SHELLY looks back at LEO.

SHELLY
Can you make him better?

DR. HAYWARD
We can maintain his current state: offer nutrition, life-support. Beyond that the only ally we have is time. I’m sorry Shelly.

SHELLY
Me too.

SHELLY looks at DR. HAYWARD.

SHELLY
Are they going to put him in prison?

DR. HAYWARD
I know he’s a suspect in several felonies.

SHELLY looks back at LEO.

SHELLY
I guess at the moment he’s kind of in prison anyway.

DR. HAYWARD
Yes he is.

SHELLY becomes upset and begins to cry. DR. HAYWARD moves over to comfort her.

DR. HAYWARD
Come on, I’ll take you back to your room. Norma’s waiting downstairs to drive you home.

DR. HAYWARD escorts SHELLY out. We ZOOM IN on the mirror reflecting the image of LEO’S face.

INSERT: CLOSE-UP PAINTED TOES

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of a foot that is also tied and rests on the back of a chair. On the foot, the toes are kept apart by cotton balls and each toe nail has been painted with red nail polish. We PAN LEFT and to FOCUS on the other foot which is in the same situation.


BACK TO SCENE:

One of the establishments 52’ PICK-UP’S, a hospitality girl, walks up a corridor carrying an ice bucket. A vacuum cleaner can still be heard RUNNING. AUDREY HORNE, wearing a long black night gown, steps out into the hall, stops the 52’ PICK-UP and reaches out for the ice bucket.

AUDREY
Hey I’ll take it from here.

52’ PICK-UP
(smiling) No, no you won’t.

AUDREY
No, it’s okay.

The 52’ PICK-UP thinks it over and then relents. She hands AUDREY the ice bucket.

52’ PICK-UP
Okay, but watch out for this one.

AUDREY
Okay.

AUDREY walks up the corridor to an open door. AUDREY enters the room and, with her hands full, shuts the door with her foot. EMORY BATTIS, the store vice-president of Horne’s Department Store, is blindfolded and wearing a robe. EMORY is lying on his back on a daybed with his hands tied together with rope that is tied to the ceiling. With his head resting at the foot of the bed, EMORY’S feet are tied and rest at the head of the bed. To the left of the bed, another 52’ PICK-UP, with long red hair and wearing a western themed outfit, pushes a vacuum cleaner that has very squeaky wheels.

Still carrying the ice bucket, AUDREY walks beside the daybed and gestures with a nod to the 52’ PICK-UP to leave. The 52’ PICK-UP shakes her head for no and continues to push the vacuum. AUDREY again nods and 52’ PICK-UP shakes her head for no again. AUDREY puts the ice bucket down on a chair that lies against the back wall of the room. AUDREY turns back to the 52’ PICK-UP and points to the door for her to leave. The 52’ PICK-UP starts to say something to AUDREY but relents. The 52’ PICK-UP lets go of the vacuum cleaner but leaves it on, presents the vacuum to AUDREY and then walks out.

AUDREY walks around the room and looks down at EMORY. AUDREY pulls the vacuum’s electrical cord out of the wall socket and the vacuum cleaner come to a quiet stop.

EMORY
Why is the vacuum cleaner off?!

AUDREY walks around EMORY, bends down and whispers in his ear ...

AUDREY
Look at those toes.

EMORY, unable to see her, turns his head towards AUDREY’S voice.

EMORY
What toes?

AUDREY stands back up.

AUDREY
I brought the ice.

EMORY
(relaxed and excited) Frosty, my little snowman. I feel the cold front moving in.

AUDREY, still holding the electrical cord from the vacuum cleaner, kneels down and wraps the cord around EMORY’S neck.

AUDREY
Mmmm.

AUDREY pulls off EMORY’S blindfold and pulls the electrical cord taut around his neck. EMORY struggles to breathe.

AUDREY
Hi ya, Emory! Do you remember me, huh?

AUDREY looks at EMORY’S tied hands and feet.

AUDREY
It really looks like you got yourself in a fix here, huh. Well guess what? I’m going to tell you a nice little bedtime story. Are you ready?

AUDREY

AUDREY
Ha - ha. I’m insane? Well I’m Audrey Horne and I get what I want.

AUDREY tugs on the cord.

AUDREY

EMORY
(submissive) Yes, alright. I work for the owner of One-Eyed Jacks.

AUDREY

EMORY

AUDREY

AUDREY tugs on the cord. Choking, EMORY gives in.

EMORY
Your father. He owns it all. Hell, he owns everything. I run girls through the perfume counter. I recruited Ronette and Laura.

AUDREY
Did Laura come here?

EMORY
One weekend. She was using drugs. We threw her out. I never saw her again I swear.

AUDREY
Did my father ...

AUDREY tugs on the cord.

AUDREY
... know that Laura was here?

EMORY
Yes, yes he did. Mr. Horne makes it his business to entertain all the girls.

AUDREY
Did she know he owned this place?

EMORY
(last attempt to resist) Owned what?

SHELLY
I don’t care about the money. I don’t want Leo home.

BOBBY
Leo is in dream land.

SHELLY looks away.

BOBBY
You can sit him in a corner and hang donuts from his ears.

SHELLY
Sheriff Truman wants me to make a statement.

BOBBY
No way. Look, they can’t force you to testify against your husband. All you’ve got to do is get Leo home, sit and collect the checks.

BOBBY gently grasps SHELLY’S chin and turns her head toward his.

BOBBY
Leo owes you baby. Now we can really make him pay. You want something nice? We can buy it. You want to go some place special, sit in the sun? It’s on Leo. Understand?

SHELLY looks away and thinks it over.

SHELLY
I guess it would be nice not to have to worry about money.

SHELLY looks back at BOBBY.

SHELLY
I have a lot of bills I have to pay.

Bills? Forget about bills. I’m talking about a new way of life.

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of an unopened envelope lying on the floor below the bed. We PAN LEFT to see AGENT COOPER’S feet.


BACK TO SCENE:

Dressed in his pajamas, AGENT COOPER sits on the edge of his bed. COOPER holds his mini tape recorder in his right hand as he speaks.

COOPER
Diane, I received some very bad news today. Windom Earle has vanished. The disappearance of my former partner is extremely troubling. I also learned that Audrey Horne is missing. Audrey’s absence touches me in ways I could not predict. I find myself thinking not of clues or of evidence but of the content of her smile.

There is a KNOCK at the door. COOPER presses the stop button on his mini recorder.

COOPER
(called out) Who is it?

MAJOR BRIGGS
It’s Major Briggs, Agent Cooper.

COOPER
(called out) Just a moment.

COOPER puts his mini recorder on the bed and slowly stands up. COOPER makes his way over to the door, unlocks it and opens it.

COOPER
Major.

MAJOR BRIGGS
May I come in?

COOPER
Please.

MAJOR BRIGGS walks inside and COOPER shuts the door. MAJOR BRIGGS is dressed in his usual Air Force uniform. MAJOR BRIGGS holds his hat in his right hand with his jacket draped over his right arm. In his left hand, MAJOR BRIGGS carries a briefcase. COOPER walks over to MAJOR BRIGGS.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I have a message for you.

COOPER
From whom?

MAJOR BRIGGS
I’m not at liberty to reveal the nature of my work. This secrecy pains me from time to time. Any bureaucracy that functions in secret inevitably lends itself to corruption. But these rules I have pledged to uphold. I believe a pledge is sacred.

COOPER
Speaking as a man and a fellow employee of the Federal Government, so do I.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Well, I may reveal this much: among my many tasks is the maintenance of deep space monitors aimed at galaxies beyond our own.

MAJOR BRIGGS places his hat and jacket on a nearby chair and lays his briefcase on the seat. MAJOR BRIGGS opens the briefcase.

MAJOR BRIGGS
We routinely receive various communications, space garbage, to decode and examine.

MAJOR BRIGGS takes a computer printout sheet out of his briefcase and holds it up in front of COOPER.

MAJOR BRIGGS
They look something like this ... radio waves and gibberish, Agent Cooper.

MAJOR BRIGGS looks down at the file and then back to COOPER.

MAJOR BRIGGS

MAJOR BRIGGS runs his finger over the lines of random numbers and letters.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Row after row of gibberish and all of a sudden ...

MAJOR BRIGGS points to one line on the page and runs his finger over it as he reads it outloud.

MAJOR BRIGGS
The owls are not what they seem.

COOPER leans toward the printout to see for himself.

DONNA
Okay, dad. I got it!

DR. HAYWARD
Okay, sweetheart!

DONNA speaks on the phone.

DONNA
