MUSIC: CALL OF THE BLACK LODGE     272K

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, ‘LOG LADY’ MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us. 

LOG LADY
Sometimes nature plays tricks on us and we imagine we are something other than what we truly are. Is this a key to life in general? Or the case of the two-headed schizophrenic? Both heads thought the other was following itself. Finally, when one head wasn’t looking, the other shot the other right between the eyes and, of course, killed himself.

INT. DALE COOPER’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

We FOCUS on the bedstand as the alarm of a collapsible traveling alarm clock goes off. FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER extends his hand and turns off the alarm. 

MUSIC: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:40 - 3:48)

COOPER reaches out further and fumbles around for his miniature tape recorder. COOPER picks it up, brings it to his mouth and clicks it on. 

COOPER
Diane, 6:42 am, approximately.

With some of his hair whipped up from his sleeping position, COOPER gets up and sits on the edge of the bed near the bedstand. 

COOPER
I dreamed I was eating a large, tasteless gumdrop.

COOPER picks up an ear plug off of the bedstand and looks it over. 

COOPER
I awoke to realize that I was aggressively munching on one of my Ear Pillow silicone ear plugs. Hence the tastelessness.

COOPER removes the other ear plug out of his ear and places them both on the bedstand. 

COOPER
Perhaps I should keep a closer eye on my afternoon coffee consumption.

COOPER gets up and picks up a pillow. 

COOPER
Uhmm, a persistent soreness in the rib area which I’m treating each morning with fifteen extra minutes of yoga discipline. After which, thankfully, the pain retreats to a cul-de-sac in a distant suburb of my conscious mind.

COOPER walks around the bed to the other side of the room and drops the pillow on the floor right next to the wall.

COOPER
I’m going to begin today with a headstand.

COOPER bends down and places his miniature tape recorder on the floor near the pillow. Next, COOPER places his hands in front of the pillow and quickly bends his head down and throws his legs up. With his back to the wall, COOPER balances himself.

COOPER
Ohh, Diane I am now upside down.


COOPER’S POV:

From COOPER’S POV we get an upside down and unfocused view underneath the bed.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Ahh, mind becoming porous.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
The day’s task coming into focus, objects growing clearer.

Directly ahead, laying on the floor beneath the bed is a white envelope.


BACK TO SCENE:

COOPER lowers his legs and uprights himself to sit on the floor. COOPER moves near the bed, reaches for the note and grabs it. Still in his pajamas, COOPER takes a seat on the floor with his back to the foot of the bed. COOPER picks up his mini tape recorder and looks over the envelope.

COOPER
Diane, the Giant was right. I did forget something.


COOPER’S POV:

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS (0:14 - 1:14)

From COOPER’S POV, we view the front of the envelope. Written in script, the envelope is addressed to:

My Special Agent
COOPER quickly opens the small envelope and unfolds a small note. It reads:

I've gone North.
Jack might have
the answer.
,Love Audrey
COOPER reads it out loud. 

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
I’ve gone North. Jack might have the answer. Love Audrey.

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - DAY

Wearing a concerned expression, DEPUTY TOMMY THE ‘HAWK’ HILL enters the building. With a coffee mug in one hand and a donut in the other, SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN walks out from the coffee station and up to HAWK. 

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hey, I thought we lost you to the Kalispell woods.

HAWK
Two retired female school teachers live in that house next to the Palmers. They have no memory of a gray haired man.

TRUMAN eats his donut. 

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hmm.

HAWK
I had to drink three pots of chamomile tea to find that out. Which reminds me, will you excuse me for a minute.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Sure.

HAWK
Thanks.

HAWK rushes off. LUCY MORAN walks up to SHERIFF TRUMAN. 

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Mmm, keep looking for the one-armed man. We’ve got to find him.

LUCY puts on a red coat. 

LUCY
Excuse me sheriff, I just wanted to say good-bye because, as you know, I’m going down to Tacoma for today to visit my sister Gwen and her husband Larry, who had a baby last week.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Right.

LUCY
That is Gwen had the baby, Larry’s the father. You remember it was a boy. Well anyway, as soon as the candored temp girl gets here I’ll explain the phones and the coffee and the ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy.

LUCY
... and the ...

TRUMAN puts his coffee and donut down in the coffee station. 

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy its okay.

LUCY
... and the wag ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN picks up LUCY’S suitcase and escorts her toward the front door. 

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy we’ve got it covered.

At the door, LUCY stops and looks at TRUMAN. 

LUCY
No, she should have been here by now. I can stay and at least show her ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy don’t worry, just go.

COOPER appears at the first set of doors at the entrance. SHERIFF TRUMAN extends the suitcase to LUCY. 

LUCY
Sometimes the candor girls can’t. But sheriff.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We’ve got it covered.

LUCY grabs her suitcase and walks out. Having not entered yet, COOPER holds the door open for LUCY. As she passes him, COOPER says ... 

COOPER
Have a safe trip Lucy.

LUCY
Thank you.

LUCY walks off. TRUMAN holds the door open for AGENT COOPER as he walks inside. 

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Good morning Coop.

COOPER
Harry.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What is the word on our delivery tonight?

COOPER
We won’t need it. We’ve got the jump on them.

AGENT COOPER brandishes a smile. 

COOPER
I know where Audrey is.

CUT TO:

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY

BOBBY BRIGGS sits in a wheelchair and has a harness around his waist that is connected to a chain that is hooked to a small lifting crane. MR. TIM PINKLE stands beside BOBBY adjusting the equipment that operates the lifting crane. BOBBY’S interest lie in the magazine, ‘Shooting’ - a magazine about guns, he is holding as MR. PINKLE rambles on about the lifting crane. 

MR. PINKLE
You see the Porto-Patient will allow you to fluently uh transport the unfortunate Mr. Johnson. Uh allowing him to ... to even uh ...

SHELLY JOHNSON, well dressed in black and smoking a cigarette, watches on. 

MR. PINKLE
... go outside and - and sit and ... and experience what he can of nature.

BOBBY diverts his attention to MR. PINKLE. 

BOBBY
Mr. Pinkle I want my cousin Leo to have the fullest possible experience of life.

MR. PINKLE takes the magazine from BOBBY and tosses it aside. MR. PINKLE pats BOBBY on the back. 

MR. PINKLE
Well that’s what we’re here for.

MR. PINKLE tugs the harness which gives BOBBY a jerk. 

MR. PINKLE
Okay let’s give it one more.

SHELLY
Mr. Pinkle are you going to install the ramp?

SHELLY gestures to the front door. 

MR. PINKLE
Well ... sure, of course ... uh of course. As a matter of fact I already have some uh ... uh some plywood ramp bo...

BOBBY snaps his fingers to correct him.

MR. PINKLE
... uh pinewood ramp boards that I’ll install tomorrow. Absolutely, that is a very good suggestion. Now I think we are ready to go. Finally, here we go alright.

MR. PINKLE moves over to the switch that operates the crane and presses the button but the motor doesn’t work. So MR. PINKLE presses it again and again.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP BELT AND MOTOR

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the belt and motor of the lifting crane as MR. PINKLE pushes the button. The belt moves slightly as the motor engages but does not run completely.


BACK TO SCENE:

MR. PINKLE
That’s a new wrinkle.

MR. PINKLE turns to BOBBY.

MR. PINKLE
(whispered) I can’t believe it it was working just so perfectly yesterday.

MR. PINKLE turns back to the switch and hits it with the bottom of his fist. 

MR. PINKLE
Come on, come ... sometimes you’ve got to be tough with these things. You got to hit it hard. A machine is like a woman we always say at the machine shop. Come on.

MR. PINKLE continues to push the button. Suddenly it roars to life and BOBBY unexpectedly gets jerked up into the air and then dropped back into his seat. 

SHELLY
Oh Bobby are you okay?!

BOBBY quickly stands up and wrestles with the harness to remove it from himself. 

BOBBY
Shelly, could you get Mr. Pinkle a cold drink please?

MR. PINKLE
A diet soda please that would be great.

BOBBY walks over to MR. PINKLE and corners him against the wall. Towering over MR. PINKLE, BOBBY snaps his fingers from both hands around his face. 

MUSIC: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:40 - 3:48)

BOBBY
Pinkle, Pinkle, Pinkle. This thing is a death trap. I told you we have to keep him alive.

MR. PINKLE
Look the insurance companies don’t exactly payoff like the slots you know. After we take our cuts we have only money for this or a first rate wheel barrel.

BOBBY hits the wall with the palm of his right hand. SHELLY returns with an open bottle of soda pop and hands it over to MR. PINKLE. 

MR. PINKLE
Oh thank you very much.

MR. PINKLE looks the bottle over. 

MR. PINKLE
Oh thanks oh uh.

MR. PINKLE walks over to his tool case. 

SHELLY
Bobby?

SHELLY motions to BOBBY to follow her to the next room.

SHELLY and BOBBY walk into the kitchen. They both stand close together face-to-face.

SHELLY
I’ve got to meet with this lawyer.

BOBBY
The hearings today right?

MR. PINKLE shouts from the next room. 

MR. PINKLE (OFF SCREEN)
Be just another second folks!

SHELLY
Bobby, are we okay?

BOBBY and SHELLY stare into each others eye’s. BOBBY gently caresses her face and slowly moves in for a kiss but is interrupted by MR. PINKLE in the next room.

We FOCUS on MR. PINKLE as he sits in the wheelchair wearing the harness that is connected to the lifting crane. MR. PINKLE reaches over and turns on the machine. Slowly, and noisily, MR. PINKLE gets lifted into the air.

MR. PINKLE
Oh that’s it. Come and take a look, you can see it. Works just fine.

We FOCUS back on BOBBY and SHELLY. BOBBY smiles at SHELLY as he holds her jaw gently with his fingertips.

BOBBY
Come outside with me. He can let himself out.

SHELLY turns around and BOBBY puts his hands on her shoulders as they walk off.

We FOCUS on MR. PINKLE suspended in the lifting harness as the lifting crane rotates the crane to a position over the bed.

MR. PINKLE
Bobby we’re doing real good.

But the crane doesn’t stop over the bed and slams MR. PINKLE against the wall.

MR. PINKLE
Uh okay that’s enough uh.

After slamming MR. PINKLE against the wall the crane rotates in the opposite direction and slams him into wall again. Again, the lifting crane rotates in the opposite direction and slams MR. PINKLE into the wall above the bed. As the crane swings MR. PINKLE around once more, he tries to reach out to the controls.

MR. PINKLE
Hey Bobby uh Bob - Bob I can’t reach the switch. Bobby I’ve got a problem here.

We view a CLOSE-UP on a gavel as it is hammered three times.


BACK TO SCENE:

Seated behind a desk that is centered on the stage is JUDGE CLINTON STERNWOOD. To the left of him is seated his law clerk, SID. To the right of him is the COURT RECORDER. The stage has the red curtains drawn behind them and two flags are positioned behind the Judge’s desk.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Mr. Palmer has pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder in the first degree. The defense has requested bail.

In the main room, all the tables have been put aside and the chairs have been placed in rows facing the stage. LELAND PALMER, dressed in a gray suit, sits in the front row. MADELEINE FERGUSON and SARAH PALMER sit together two rows behind LELAND.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
This pretrial hearing is to determine whether that bail will be granted.

Separated by an aisle, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN sit to the left of LELAND. AGENT COOPER sits in the row behind ANDY. TOAD sits behind COOPER eating away at a hamburger.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Mister Prosecutor.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY DARYL LODWICK gets up from his chair where he was seated at a table positioned between the rows of chairs and the stage. To the right of him sits the defense attorney at a different table. LODWICK walks near the stage and paces as he speaks.

LODWICK
We the people of the state of Washington move that the defendant be denied bail. On the basis of: one, the great seriousness of the crime for which he has been accused; two, the apparently premeditated nature of this act; and three, the oft witnessed instability of Mr. Palmer during the period following the death of his daughter.

SARAH looks at the expression on her husband’s face.

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS (1:03 - 4:34)

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Sheriff Truman will speak for the defense.

SHERIFF TRUMAN stands up. ANDY is drawing on a sketch pad.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Your honor, Leland Palmer is a well known, well liked, well respected member of this community.

Pleased by the comment, LELAND looks over to SHERIFF TRUMAN as does SARAH.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
His roots go way back. His grandfather, Joshua Palmer, brought the family here more than 75 years ago

Seated at the bar, BENJAMIN HORNE tosses peanuts into his mouth as he listens to the trial.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Your honor, no one ... can know ... what its like to lose a daughter the way Leland did. That’s all.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Thank you sheriff.

MUSIC ENDS: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS (1:03 - 4:34)

SHERIFF TRUMAN sits back down.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Mr. Lodwick uh would you care to present ...

ANDY
(whispered to TRUMAN) I thought I might sell this to the gazette. They seem to like court room sketches.

SHERIFF TRUMAN looks over the sketch ANDY made.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP SKETCH

We view a CLOSE-UP of the sketch ANDY has been working on. The sketch is a black outline of the back of LELAND’S head.

JUDGE STERNWOOD (OFF SCREEN)
... any further testimony?

There is no response.

JUDGE STERNWOOD (OFF SCREEN)
So witnesses for the defense, thank you gentlemen.


BACK TO SCENE:

COOPER bends forward and pokes his head between ANDY and TRUMAN to take a look at sketch.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(whispered to ANDY) Well why don’t you try for a little more face then that.


ANDY’S POV:

Through ANDY’S POV we look over to LELAND and see mostly the back end of his left profile.

JUDGE STERNWOOD (OFF SCREEN)
On the basis of this high standing community and the pristine nature of his public and ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN (OFF SCREEN)
(whispered to ANDY) Just an idea.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP SKETCH

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the sketch ANDY is working on. The sketch is composed of the exact view ANDY is getting of LELAND.

JUDGE STERNWOOD (OFF SCREEN)

BACK TO SCENE:

ANDY
(whispered to TRUMAN) Good, thanks sheriff.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
... and his respect for law, the defendant is released on his own recognizance.

LELAND smiles. SARAH and MADELEINE are relieved.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Now Leland ...

LELAND stands up.

JUDGE STERNWOOD

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME (PIANO SOLO)

JUDGE STERNWOOD

BENJAMIN tosses another peanut into his mouth, stands up and makes his way to the door - all the while he casts an eye towards LELAND.

JUDGE STERNWOOD

SID writes on her calendar. LELAND smiles as he stands.

INT. HAROLD SMITH’S APARTMENT - DAY

At the door, HAROLD SMITH unlocks the deadbolt and opens the door to reveal DONNA HAYWARD holding a food tray. HAROLD holds a glass of wine in his right hand. HAROLD smiles at DONNA.

HAROLD
Hi.

DONNA
Hi.

HAROLD
Thank you.

HAROLD grabs the tray from DONNA and places it on top of a cabinet just to the left of her. HAROLD lifts the metal cover off the plate of food.

HAROLD
Oh ... mmm.

Still standing by the door and facing each other, HAROLD takes a sip from his glass.

HAROLD
So, what’s behind those deep blue eyes today?

DONNA
I’ve got a proposition for you. Share my life with you, tell it to you, part of your living novel. If you let me read Laura’s diary.

MUSIC: HAROLD’S THEME   32K

HAROLD walks into the room and thinks it over.

HAROLD
Its intriguing.

HAROLD turns back to face DONNA.

HAROLD
I’ll read it to you ... but it mustn’t physically leave this room.

DONNA
Acceptable.

HAROLD motions to DONNA to enter. They both walk into the room.

HAROLD
You’ll start?

DONNA turns to face HAROLD.

DONNA
Of course.

HAROLD
A bargain has been struck.

HAROLD gestures to DONNA to take a seat on the chair. DONNA removes her long black coat, to reveal a pink top and blue skirt, and takes a seat on the chair. HAROLD moves over to the bookcase behind her and bends down. HAROLD positions his right hand on a triangular headed wooden peg that holds a shelf in place. He turns the peg and the shelf and backing move forward. This small cache reveals half a dozen small books. HAROLD looks over his shoulder to DONNA. DONNA had been watching and quickly turns away. HAROLD grabs one book out of the cache and closes it back up.

HAROLD stands back up, grabs his glass of wine and walks over to his desk that is positioned in front of DONNA. HAROLD smiles at DONNA as he passes her. HAROLD takes a seat at the desk, grabs a pen, and writes on the front of a Mead composition pad.

HAROLD
Donna ... Hayward.

HAROLD opens the small book to the first page, creases it down, places a fine cloth bookmark on that page and writes the date.

HAROLD
Begin.

DONNA
Alright. I’m from Twin Peaks. Actually, I was born here. My father delivered me, he’s a doctor. Where are you from?

HAROLD is caught off guard by the question.

HAROLD
I grew up in Boston. (slightly embarrassed) Well, actually, I grew up in books.

DONNA boldly leans forward.

DONNA
There’s things you can’t get in books.

HAROLD
There’s things you can’t get anywhere ... but we dream that they can be found in other people.

Slightly embarrassed, HAROLD smiles.

HAROLD
Continue.

DONNA
Maybe our dreams are real.

HAROLD turns to look at DONNA, slightly amazed by her statement. DONNA stares at HAROLD but quickly and unexpectedly grabs LAURA’S diary from table.

DONNA
My turn.

DONNA stands up and backs up toward the door. Concerned, HAROLD stands up.

HAROLD
What are you doing?

DONNA
(smiling) Maybe I’ll read it out here on the lawn.

HAROLD moves toward DONNA but she backs up closer to the door.

HAROLD
Please, we only just started.

DONNA
Why don’t you come with me. Come on, what’s there to be afraid of?

DONNA opens the door and steps outside.

DONNA
Come on.

Still shaking, HAROLD looks up to the sky.

DONNA

DONNA drops the book beside him and puts her hands around his head to try to comfort him.

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of a gavel as it is hammered three times.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP ENLARGED PHOTOGRAPH

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of an enlarged black and white photograph of LEO JOHNSON that is supported on an easle on the stage.


BACK TO SCENE:

JUDGE STERNWOOD sits behind a desk that is centered on the stage. STERNWOOD’S law clerk, SID, sits to the left of him. The court recorder sits to the right of STERNWOOD. The stage has the red curtains drawn behind them and has two flags positioned behind the Judge’s desk. 

JUDGE STERNWOOD
The defense will continue with its evidence. If you would Mr. Racine.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY MR. RACINE stands up. MR. RACINE and his female law clerk, who are oddly dressed in same the brown suits and ribbon ties, are sitting together at a table just in front of the stage. To the left of MR. RACINE sits the district attorney at a different table. MR. RACINE holds up a computer print out.

RACINE
You can see from these EEG’s, this chart here which is actually of my own head ...


INSERT: CLOSE-UP EEG CHART

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the EEG chart and see that lines that represent brain activity are of varying scribbled wavy lines.

RACINE (OFF SCREEN)
... is intended to show normal brain activity ...


BACK TO SCENE:

MR. LODWICK stands up in protest.

LODWICK
Objection to the use of the word normal, your honor.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Well he’s close enough. Objection overruled.

Disappointed, MR. LODWICK sits back down.

RACINE
This chart here is of Mr. Johnson and shows minimal activity.


INSERT: CLOSE-UP EEG CHART

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of another EEG chart and see that lines that represent brain activity are nearly straight lines instead of varying scribbled waves.


BACK TO SCENE:

MR. RACINE hands the EEG charts to SID who passes the charts to JUDGE STERNWOOD.

RACINE
Previously submitted medical reports states that Mr. Johnson has suffered diffuse brain damage. He doesn’t currently even have the perspicacity to take the standard CST competency test.

MR. RACINE walks across the front of the stage and up to the poster of LEO JOHNSON. MR. RACINE points to the enlarged photograph of LEO’S picture while in a coma.

RACINE
We therefore submit that trying this individual constitute a mockery of the justice system. A proceeding that the unfortunate young man would not even faintly comprehend.

JUDGE STERNWOOD nods his approval of the argument.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Mister prosecutor.

In the row of chairs behind the tables, SHERIFF TRUMAN sits behind the prosecutor table. SHELLY sits behind the table of the defense. AGENT COOPER sits behind SHELLY. MR. LODWICK sternly looks at MR. RACINE, scratches his beard and then stands up.

LODWICK
I know Leo Johnson isn’t in very good shape. On the surface it might seem ridiculous to make him stand trial but the trial does more then just punish the wrongdoer. It also brings a feeling of justice and retribution to a community.

JUDGE STERNWOOD rolls his eyes.

LODWICK
Among the various crimes Leo Johnson is suspected of, the murder of Laura Palmer is the sort that can wound an entire town. As long as Leo Johnson carries a breath he is ...

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Alright, alright.

LODWICK
... as eminently deserving of a trial ...

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Alright. Alright!

LODWICK
... as this community is of a sense of resolution!

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Alright! Now have a seat Mr. Lodwick.

Again disappointed, MR. LODWICK rubs his beard and takes a seat.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Now you fellas can catch your breath. Uh I uh ... am going to need to deliberate.

JUDGE STERNWOOD stands up.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Uh Mr. Cooper, Sheriff Truman if I could have the pleasure of your company.

COOPER raises his left hand. 

We FOCUS on SID as she walks behind the bar of the Roadhouse. JUDGE STERNWOOD, SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER walk over to the bar and take a seat.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Sid, can you fix us up with three black Yukon sucker punches?

SID
Yes your honor.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Lodwick really planted his feet and looked me in the eye. I didn’t expect him to press on the murder charge.

COOPER passes out napkins.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Cooper, is Leo Johnson our man?

COOPER
No sir, I don’t believe he is.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Harry, what’s the temperature of the town, uh do they want a trial or a lynching?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
They want the right man brought to justice.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Hmm well they don’t need a circus ... and this poor bastard, he seems to be a heady cabbage. Thoughts Cooper?

SID places a tall straight glass, half filled with a dark liquid and the top half filled with a blue foamy head, in front of each of them.

COOPER
I feel the killer with eventually be apprehended.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
You have to watch these. They sneak up on ya’.

JUDGE STERNWOOD and SHERIFF TRUMAN take a drink. COOPER nervously eyes the glass and does not take a drink. As TRUMAN continues to drink, JUDGE STERNWOOD turns his head to look back into the room.

COOPER picks up the glass and looks at its blue foamy contents. SHERIFF TRUMAN pats JUDGE STERNWOOD’S left arm.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thanks Clinton.

SHERIFF TRUMAN gets up and leaves the bar to tell SHELLY the news. COOPER smells the contents of his glass.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Cooper, how long ya’ been here?

COOPER
Twelve days sir.

We FOCUS on SHERIFF TRUMAN as he takes a seat next to SHELLY. Facing SHELLY, TRUMAN puts a hand on top of her hands which she has crossed on her knee.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

SHELLY
Oh.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leo is coming home.

Treating it as good news, SHERIFF TRUMAN smiles.

COOPER and JUDGE STERNWOOD remain seated at the bar. COOPER has still not touched his drink.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
I’ll advise you to keep your eyes on the woods. The woods are wondrous here ... but strange.

We FOCUS on SHELLY as she responds to TRUMAN.

SHELLY
Thanks.

SHERIFF TRUMAN pats SHELLY’S hand and leaves. SHELLY, however, isn’t happy with the news and lets out a small sigh.

BIG ED, holding NADINE’S arm, pushes her into the room.

BIG ED
Why don’t you sit down honey. Let me get you a drink.

NADINE
Oh no, I’ll get it.

NADINE walks away with a bounce in her step but before she reaches the kitchen she stops and then quickly turns around. With a frightened expression on her face, NADINE asks ...

NADINE
Where are mom and dad!?

Caught off guard by the question BIG ED nervously looks back to JAMES but quickly answers ...

BIG ED
Ohhhh uhhhhh, out of town.

NADINE
Oh, okay.

NADINE’S smile returns, turns around and hops into the kitchen as she sings ...

NADINE
You’re a jack and I’m a jack. A steeple jack ...

JAMES and BIG ED are now alone in the room.

JAMES
(whispered) Wow!

BIG ED wears a perplexed expression.

BIG ED
Doc Hayward said to roll with the punches.

JAMES
Have you thought about maybe taking her to see Dr. Jacoby?

BIG ED
Nahhh, he’s in Hawaii recovering from that heart attack.

A sudden SCREECH of wrenching metal and a THUD comes from kitchen. BIG ED and JAMES look towards the doorway of the kitchen as NADINE steps into the room holding the door of the refrigerator, by its handle, in her left hand.

BLACKIE
What about Ben Horne?

BLACKIE takes the strawberry off of the knife and slowly eats at it. JEAN wipes the blades of the knife with his fingers and then licks his fingers.

Well, he give up control of One-Eyed Jack’s. Its yours.

JEAN reloads the knife into its firing position.

Seated at LUCY’S station, ANDY reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a slip of paper. ANDY dials the telephone.

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)
(from telephone) Laboratory services.

We slowly ZOOM OUT to see that the office, and ANDY included, are covered with small yellow Post-It notes.

ANDY
Yeah, I’m calling for some test results. Doc Hayward said I could just call ya’ up and ...

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)

ANDY
What’s it for?

ANDY
Sorry, Brennan Andy.

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)

ANDY
Yes, could you go slower. I want to write all of this down.

Holding the phone with his left hand, ANDY grabs a pencil and writes on a Post-It note with his right hand.

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)

ANDY
O-gli-o Sper-mia.

NURSE (OFF SCREEN)

ANDY hangs up the phone. In the background, SHERIFF TRUMAN walks out from around the corner of the hallway.

ANDY
I’m a whole damn town!

Overhearing ANDY, SHERIFF TRUMAN walks up to the open door of the reception office where ANDY is seated.

ANDY
I’m a whole damn town.

Oblivious to what is going on, SHERIFF TRUMAN simply smiles and nods his head. TRUMAN walks off. Elated, ANDY shouts ...

ANDY
Wheewww!

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks into his office and closes the door. AGENT COOPER, sitting at TRUMAN’S desk, turns around and gives him a puzzled look as to what the shout was about.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Don’t ask. Where were we?

On the desk, is a floor plan of One-Eyed Jacks that was drawn by COOPER. The various rooms in the plan are labeled as COOPER points them out.

COOPER
Okay, main bar and greeting room here, casino and get acquainted room.

There is a KNOCK at the door.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What’s this, Blackie’s office?

The door opens and DEPUTY HAWK enters the office holding a small plastic bag.

COOPER
We’ll find out when we get there.

COOPER quickly flips the plan over to hide it from HAWK. SHERIFF TRUMAN moves behind his desk as HAWK moves up to them.

HAWK
The one-armed man is staying at the Robin’s Nest Motel on highway nine. Nobody’s seen him for at least a day - day and a half. The room looks lived in. I found this, same drug as last time.

HAWK open the plastic bag and smells its contents.

HAWK
A weird, deep smell.

HAWK hands the bag over to SHERIFF TRUMAN who opens it and smells its contents.

COOPER
We’re still waiting on Albert’s analysis, good work Hawk.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hawk, see ya’ in the morning.

Suspicious of the two, HAWK nods to them and walks toward the door. Before he leaves, HAWK takes one last look into the room. After the door has closed, COOPER flips the plan over and continues to explain his approach to finding AUDREY.

COOPER
Okay, we’ll approach through the woods to the rear door. Inside are stairs leading down to the working rooms.

MUSIC: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (2:12 - 2:31)

COOPER
My guess is that is where Audrey is being held.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What kinda of muscle do they have?

COOPER
A couple of floor men in the casino probably more in the back.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Let’s go get her.

MUSIC ENDS: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (2:12 - 2:31)

SHERIFF TRUMAN gets up from his seat behind his desk and grabs his coat and hat. AGENT COOPER rolls up the plan, grabs his coat and walks out of the office. COOPER and TRUMAN pass by ANDY, in the reception office, as they exit out the front door of the building.

COOPER
Good night Andy.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
See ya’ in the morning Andy, good work.

ANDY is too occupied to respond to COOPER and TRUMAN as they leave. ANDY looks through all the yellow scraps of Post-It notes he has scattered throughout the office. ANDY lifts a note pad out of the way and finds what he was looking for on a card marked:

ANDY
Gwen and Larry.

ANDY grabs the telephone and dials one of the telephone numbers. ANDY gets a connection.

DONNA
Dear diary. (smiles) Uh this is from a long time ago, is that okay?

HAROLD nods his head for yes.

DONNA
I was about thirteen years old, fourteen maybe. Me and Laura put on our tightest, shortest skirts - too tight. Laura talked me into it. We were going to the Roadhouse to meet boys. Their names are Josh, Rick and Tim. They’re about twenty years old and they’re nice to us.

DONNA grabs herself a cigarette, lights it up and deeply expels the smoke.

DONNA
And they make us feel like we’re older. Rick asked if we want to go party and Laura says yes and all of a sudden I feel this knot building up in my stomach. But when Laura gets in the truck with Rick I go anyway. Stream in the woods. Full moon I think. Its pale and light out.

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

Acting out the scene, DONNA stands up, holds out her arms and slowly twirls around in the middle of the room. HAROLD stops writing and watches her.

DONNA
Laura starts to dance around the boys.

DONNA stops and then moves her hips.

DONNA
She begins to move her hips ... back and forth.

DONNA stops moving her hips and folds her arms to her chest.

DONNA
Rick starts to clap but Tim doesn’t do anything he just watches. Somehow that makes me angry. So I say, ‘lets go skinny dipping’. So we take off our clothes.

DONNA tugs at her top near the neckline. HAROLD stares at her intensely.

DONNA
I know the boys are watching. Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick. I don’t know what to do. So I swim away.

DONNA backs up.

DONNA
I feel like I want to run but I don’t. Tim swims out to me.

DONNA moves forward, holds her left hand up and closes her eyes.

DONNA
He kisses my hand and then me.

DONNA runs her fingers over her lips.

DONNA
I can still feel that kiss. His lips are warm and sweet. My heart jumps. He’s talking to me but I can’t hear him.

DONNA opens her eyes.

DONNA
A hug and a kiss. I never saw him again. It was the first time I ever fell in love.

Tears form in DONNA’S eyes. DONNA sits back down in her chair.

DONNA
That’s all.

We FOCUS on the GUARD at the back door to the building as he continues to smoke his cigarette. The GUARD has no time to react as SHERIFF TRUMAN walks up to his right side and grabs his crotch - and grabs tightly. The GUARD freezes, raises his head up and grunts in pain. TRUMAN quickly places a blue rubber ball into his mouth, to gag him, and places some black tape over his mouth. TRUMAN turns him around, grabs him by the back of his hair and slams him head first into the double French doors of the building, which open slightly as the GUARD’S head hits the doors. The GUARD falls back on the ground out cold. COOPER quickly comes out from behind the bushes and helps TRUMAN move the GUARD inside the building.

The walls of the hallway are covered with red drapes and there are small bronze statues on pedestals positioned equidistant and across from each other. COOPER and TRUMAN look around. COOPER unfolds his plan of the building.

COOPER

SHERIFF TRUMAN follows COOPER into another hallway that is wallpapered with a flower design. A doorway draped with red curtains has several GENTLEMEN and WORKING GIRLS inside. A ’52 PICK-UP and CUSTOMER #2 leave the room and enter the hallway. COOPER and TRUMAN turn away so as to not be noticed. The ’52 PICK-UP looks at them but pays them no bother. She and her customer walk down the hall. All clear, COOPER and TRUMAN walk down the hall.

COOPER and TRUMAN pass a bend in the hallway. COOPER checks his map. As COOPER and TRUMAN pass a closed door they hear a woman gasp. COOPER stops and puts his head near the door to listen if its a woman in trouble. The woman giggles so COOPER and TRUMAN move on. COOPER and TRUMAN come to a fork in the hallway.

COOPER
Wait here Harry.

COOPER walks down one of the hallways as TRUMAN looks around as he waits at the fork of the hallway. COOPER returns.

COOPER
Nah, dead end.

With SHERIFF TRUMAN leading, COOPER and TRUMAN both walk down the other fork of the hallway. As TRUMAN passes another bend in the hallway he turns his head to look into a glass French door. Alerted by people in that room he takes a quick step back and holds out his left arm to warn and stop COOPER. TRUMAN carefully peers into the room.


SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV:

Through SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV we look through the veiled glass door and into BLACKIE’S office. With their backs to the door, JEAN and BLACKIE are standing near her desk.

TRUMAN turns to COOPER and holds up two fingers.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

TRUMAN shakes his head for no. COOPER quickly points at his chest and then down the hall - a nonverbal message that he’s going to walk down the hall. TRUMAN nods his understanding. COOPER walks off. TRUMAN stays near the door and returns to looking into BLACKIE’S office.


SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV:

Again through SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV we look through the veiled glass door of BLACKIE’S office. To the left of BLACKIE’S desk is a monitor which has the image of AGENT COOPER in his tuxedo, the night he was looking for JACQUES RENAULT.

HAROLD slowly moves to DONNA’S lips and gently kisses her. HAROLD kisses DONNA again with another small touch on the lips. DONNA places a hand on his cheek as they kiss. DONNA’S kiss becomes more passionate but HAROLD starts to back off. DONNA leans forward as she continues to kiss him but HAROLD finally breaks away.

HAROLD
Will you excuse me a minute.

MUSIC ENDS: HAROLD’S THEME   68K

HAROLD walks away. DONNA stares in his direction in confusion.

We FOCUS on DONNA as she walks into the dark main room of the apartment. DONNA goes through her purse for a flashlight. DONNA picks up the flashlight, walks over to the front window by the door and through the open Venetian blinds repeatedly turns the flashlight on and off as a signal for MADELEINE.

AGENT COOPER walks into the open door of a room. NANCY O’REILLEY quickly walks up to him. COOPER puts on a friendly act as he smiles and moves a hand out to shake hands with NANCY.

COOPER
Hi, would you take me to ...

As NANCY holds her hand out to shake his hand, COOPER quickly grabs her hand, twirls her around and bends her arm behind her back.

COOPER
... Audrey Horne please.

NANCY grimaces in pain. COOPER grabs NANCY’S other arm.

NANCY
Oww, I don’t think she available.

Let’s double check.

MUSIC: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (2:12 - 3:24)

COOPER throws NANCY into the room. COOPER walks over to AUDREY. NANCY clings to a tall corner bed post at the foot of the bed. COOPER kneels down close to AUDREY and touches her face.

NANCY
Its not my idea, okay. You’re nothing but meat on a hook to these people.

COOPER quickly turns to NANCY.

COOPER
Shut up.

COOPER returns his attention to AUDREY.

COOPER
Audrey can you hear me?

AUDREY groans and moves slightly. With COOPER preoccupied with AUDREY and being partially concealed by the red drapes on the bed post, NANCY bends down and pulls her knife out of her boot. As NANCY gets her knife, COOPER looks over his shoulder and with the help of a mirror against the wall spots her actions but doesn’t react yet. AUDREY opens her eyes.

AUDREY
My prayers.

COOPER
Oh Audrey, I’m going to take you out of here.

Holding the knife down in the right fist of her hand, NANCY slowly moves from behind the red curtain and over to COOPER. Without even looking back, COOPER reaches out with his left hand and grabs NANCY’S wrist. Still on his knees, he throws her against the wall and punches her in the stomach. NANCY collapses to the floor. COOPER grabs NANCY’S knife and uses it to cut the rope that ties AUDREY to the bedpost. COOPER picks AUDREY up, tosses her over his shoulder and carries her out of the room.

As COOPER and TRUMAN enter the hallway with the red drapes that lead to the stairs outside, a man dressed in a tuxedo, GUARD #2, stands waiting for them near the stairs holding a gun pointed at them. SHERIFF TRUMAN has his revolver drawn but not aimed to used so GUARD #2 tells him ... 

GUARD #2
Drop the gun, slowly.

COOPER grits his teeth. TRUMAN reluctantly drops his gun on the floor.

GUARD #2
Now turn around.

COOPER and TRUMAN don’t react right away so GUARD #2 cocks his gun. Disappointed, COOPER and TRUMAN turn around.

With the sound of a SWOOSH an object hits GUARD #2 in the back. GUARD #2 grunts, freezes and then quickly falls forward onto the floor dead to reveal a huge Bowie knife jutting out of his back.

Hearing the sound of GUARD #2 hitting the ground, COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN turn around and are baffled. They look up the stairway to see DEPUTY HAWK, dressed in civilian clothes, walking down the stairs. HAWK stops halfway down the stairs and hunches over.

Good thing you guys can’t keep a secret.

INT. HAROLD SMITH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:35)

Standing in the plant nursery portion of the apartment but looking through the glass window into the next room, DONNA tries to direct MADELEINE to the specific bookshelf by pointing down.

We FOCUS on MADELEINE, standing by the bookcase in the dark, as she looks at DONNA and follows her gesture by bending down to the bottom bookshelf.

Nervously, DONNA peers over her shoulder to see if everything is clear and then quickly returns to directing MADELEINE. Now at the right bookshelf, DONNA gestures and quietly mouths go around for MADELEINE to reach around the corner of the bookcase.

We FOCUS on MADELEINE as she looks around the corner of the bookcase.

DONNA stares into the dark room as HAROLD walks up behind her and taps her on the back. DONNA nervously jerks around to face HAROLD. DONNA breathes heavily and appears distressed, unaware of what’s going on HAROLD holds up another orchid and asks ...

MUSIC: HAROLD’S THEME   68K

HAROLD
Something wrong?

DONNA
No, you just frightened me that’s all.

We FOCUS on MADEILENE as she finds the peg and tries to turn it. MADEILENE looks back into the plant nursery through the window and sees DONNA occupied with HAROLD.

DONNA tries to think of way to keep HAROLD occupied.

DONNA
Uh, come here. Tell me about this orchid, this one.

DONNA rushes over to a flower away from the window. HAROLD can tell that something is wrong by DONNA’S sudden strange behavior.

We FOCUS on MADELEINE as she turns the peg that holds the bookshelf in place. MADELEINE pulls the peg out of its hole. Next, MADELEINE pulls the bookshelf forward but its loaded with so many books that the heavy bookshelf falls downward with a loud THUD.

HAROLD hears the loud THUD coming from the next room and looks into the dark main room through the plant nursery window.

MUSIC: HAROLD’S DARKNESS

We FOCUS on MADELEINE as she finds the diary and picks it up. Knowing she has been discovered, MADELEINE stands up and faces the plant nursery window.

Now realizing what was going on, HAROLD, still by the window, lowers his head in disappointment. HAROLD turns around and faces DONNA.

DONNA
Harold no, you don’t understand.

HAROLD turns to his right and walks over to a shelf where he places a flower vase with an orchid he had been holding. HAROLD reaches for a pair of shears but then grabs a hand gardening fork off of the shelf. HAROLD moves to walk into the next room. DONNA sees the gardening fork and rushes to the next room.

DONNA
MADDY!

Two doors allow access into the plant nursery, DONNA exits the door on the left and HAROLD exits the door on the right. DONNA rushes over to MADEILENE and they cling to each other before HAROLD gets there brandishing the hand fork.

DONNA
(shouts) WAIT!

HAROLD backs off slightly.

HAROLD
(shouts) ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SECRETS!

DONNA and MADEILENE shake in fear as they hold each other. HAROLD has tears in his eyes.

HAROLD
(calmly) Is that what all this is about. Well maybe I can help you. Do you know what the ultimate secret is? Do you want to know ... what Laura did?

HAROLD holds the hand fork nears his face and closes his eyes.

HAROLD
The secret of knowing who killed you.

HAROLD drags the hand gardening fork down on his face. Blood seeps from the scratches. MADELEINE screams and buries her head in DONNA’S shoulder.
