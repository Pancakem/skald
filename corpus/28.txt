MUSIC: CALL OF THE BLACK LODGE     272K

As she speaks directly to us, the ‘LOG LADY’ MARGARET LANTERMEN holds her wooden log in her arms like a baby. The LOG LADY sits with her back to the fireplace of her cabin and beside a table.

LOG LADY
There are clues everywhere, all around us. But the puzzle maker is clever. The clues, although surrounding us, are somehow mistaken for something else. And the something else, the wrong interpretation of the clues, we call our world. Our world is a magical smoke screen. How should we interpret the happy song of the meadowlark or the robust flavor of a wild strawberry?

We PAN DOWN.


CLOSE ON: RUSTY TOMASKI

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of RUSTY TOMASKI’S frozen expression peering out through the facial cavity of a large black pawn built by WINDOM EARLE. The pawn begins to move back and forth.

DEPUTY #1 (OFF SCREEN)
That’s it. Rock it.

DEPUTY #2 (OFF SCREEN)
Keep it going.

DEPUTY #1 (OFF SCREEN)
A little more.

DEPUTY #2 (OFF SCREEN)
Hold it.


BACK TO SCENE:

In the gazebo of Easter Park, seven LAWMEN work at rocking the giant black pawn. A DEPUTY jumps up and over the railing to the gazebo to lend a hand. The LAWMEN continue to rock the giant black pawn until it leans heavily to one side toward the exit.

DEPUTY #1
Okay, watch it. Hold it - hold it.

DEPUTY #2
Hold it. Got it? Got it?

DEPUTY #1
Thank you.

Collectively, the LAWMEN work to pick the giant pawn up and move it out of the gazebo.

DEPUTY #2
Put it on your shoulder - on your shoulder.

DEPUTY #3
Watch your step.

DEPUTY TOMMY ‘THE HAWK’ HILL removes a tie of yellow police cautionary tape from the gazebo railing.

DEPUTY #1
Watch your step - watch your step.

DEPUTY #2
Look out, easy - easy.

DEPUTY #3
If you need some help down there say something.

DEPUTY #1
Okay.

DEPUTY #3
I’ll watch your foot.

DEPUTY #1
You look out and see if I’m going to fast.

DEPUTY #2
Woah - woah - woah - woah. Easy.

We FAVOR ON the LAWMEN and PAN LEFT as they now zigzag past parked police cruisers, with their lights flashing, as they move the giant black pawn towards a trailer.

DEPUTY #1
Come on, you okay?

DEPUTY #3
Yeah, it hit me in the eye.

DEPUTY #1
Look - look, what’s going on?

DEPUTY #2
Come on. That’s it. Hold it.

DEPUTY #1
I’ll go out the back.

DEPUTY #2
Oh, watch where you step.

As the LAWMEN continue to move the giant black pawn in the background, we FOCUS on a huddle between FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER, SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN, DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN and RUSTY’S friend, a HEAVY METAL ROADIE. The HEAVY METAL ROADIE wears a red baseball cap and a black leather vest over a jean jacket over a black concert shirt.

HEAVY METAL ROADIE
Oh man, Rusty?

COOPER
What was Rusty’s last name?

HEAVY METAL ROADIE
Tomaski. He got me in with the band. I - I’m a roady.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What are you doing in Twin Peaks?

HEAVY METAL ROADIE
We were supposed to play a gig in Knife River but a tire on the van crapped out.

COOPER
And you met someone.

HEAVY METAL ROADIE
Yeah, this guy - this guy came out of the woods, like Big Foot or something, and uhm he was wearing a weird suit and we talked to him for a while and he said he had some brew. You know, like we uh - uh like some. So Rusty went with him. I - I didn’t see him after that.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We’ll need to get in touch with Rusty’s parents.

DEPUTY #2
Stand clear!

ANDY begins to get choked up, saddened by the story. HEAVY METAL ROADIE speaks with a growing nervous chuckle.

HEAVY METAL ROADIE
Rusty hated his parents. He’s staying with his uncle in Moses Lake. Until we were - we were gonna ... move. We were gonna move to LA.

ANDY begins to cry. Caught up in his emotions, the HEAVY METAL ROADIE begins to cry also.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(scoldingly) Andy.

In the background the LAWMEN continue to wrestle with the giant black pawn in the trailer.

DEPUTY #2
Out!

DEPUTY #1
My foot! Stop pushing!

DEPUTY #2
Watch it!

SHERIFF TRUMAN pats ANDY’S shoulder and gestures that he should lead the HEAVY METAL ROADIE away.

DEPUTY ANDY escorts the HEAVY METAL ROADIE away.

COOPER
He’s taken another pawn Harry but he didn’t tell us his move. Windom Earle’s playing off the board.

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - DAY

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of a chess set lying on LUCY MORAN’S reception office counter. Seated nearby, LUCY reaches out and picks up the white queen from the chess set.

We PAN UP and RIGHT. LUCY is sitting in her reception office in front of the open office window. In the background, two DEPUTIES work on collecting clues from the dismantled giant black pawn in the reception area.

MUSIC ENDS: MILL FIRE     16K

SHERIFF TRUMAN enters the building and, wearing a smile, taps the counter at the reception office window twice.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Morning Lucy.

LUCY
Morning Sheriff Truman.

AGENT COOPER follows right behind SHERIFF TRUMAN. Smiling, COOPER crouches slightly and also taps the counter at the reception office window, three times.

COOPER
Morning Lucy.

LUCY
Agent Cooper.

SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER head towards TRUMAN’S office. DEPUTY ANDY follows right behind them carrying two pink boxes of donuts.

TRUMAN and COOPER stop short as LUCY speaks to them.

LUCY
Deputy Hawk is in your office sheriff. He’s with somebody I’ve never seen before but he looks really sad so Hawk is feeding him breakfast.

SHERIFF TRUMAN waves an index finger on his left hand - quietly gesturing that he’s got it.

TRUMAN, COOPER and ANDY walk off towards the office.

LUCY
Andy?

Still holding the donut boxes, ANDY stops, turns towards LUCY and walks up to her reception office window.

ANDY
Yes Lucy.

LUCY
What do you know about saving our planet?

ANDY
I know its in a lot of trouble.

LUCY
Andy, I’m taking fate into my own hands, mostly because the suspense is too much for me.

LUCY hands ANDY the photocopy ad for the Miss Twin Peaks contest.

LUCY
Tomorrow is D-Day, dad day. In twenty-four hours I will choose the father of my child: Deputy Andy Brennan ...

ANDY smiles brightly.

LUCY
... or clothing salesman Richard Tremayne.

ANDY drops his smile.

ANDY
What does that have to do with the Miss Twin Peaks contest?

LUCY
I ... I mean we ...

LUCY looks down at her abdomen and tugs at her shirt.

LUCY
... could use the money. We could also use a father. So I have to make a speech about saving our planet. Which is a great concept but I have no idea how to go about it, yet.

ANDY
I do know that people have got to stop sinking their beer cans in Pearl Lake when they’re fishing.

LUCY grabs a pencil and a pad of paper to take notes.

LUCY
Ah, beer cans.

ANDY
And uhm ... Styrofoam never dies for as long as you live.

Stunned by that information, LUCY looks up to ANDY, wide-eyed.

LUCY
It doesn’t?

DR. HAYWARD turns around to face BEN.

DR. HAYWARD

BENJAMIN
I know that I’ve given you reason to doubt me ... but I’m only interested in doing the right thing for everybody.

DR. HAYWARD walks towards BEN.

DR. HAYWARD
Then stay away from Eileen.

BENJAMIN
I can’t. Not as long as the lie survives.

DR. HAYWARD walks up to BEN.

DR. HAYWARD
Damn it Ben its not that simple. I believe you. I applaud your desire to do the right thing but goodness in you is ... is like a time bomb. There’s nothing good about ruined lives.

BENJAMIN
It is a confusing and difficult process but I must continue. Sorry Will.

There’s a KNOCK at the door.

DR. HAYWARD
Nice to see you again John.

DR. HAYWARD makes his way out of the office but before he leaves he turns back to BEN.

DR. HAYWARD leaves through the open office door.

CUT TO:

INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

We FOCUS on a Styrofoam cup, with a nibbled lip, that is used to hold three pencils. MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS grabs and pulls out a pencil from the cup. We PAN LEFT and then UP to FOCUS on MAJOR BRIGGS and CAPPY, one of the BOOKHOUSE BOYS.

MAJOR BRIGGS
See if any of these symbols have to do with harvest schedules or ancient calendars. Look for any curious nomenclature.

MAJOR BRIGGS hands CAPPY a notepad.

CAPPY
Got it chief.

CAPPY takes the notepad, grabs a few more notes and walks off. As he is about to leave the office he bumps into SHERIFF TRUMAN.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Good work Cappy.

TRUMAN pats CAPPY on the shoulder before letting him leave. SHERIFF TRUMAN walks up to MAJOR BRIGGS. AGENT COOPER follows right behind TRUMAN. Both are carrying cups of coffee.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Major?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Harry.

MAJOR BRIGGS and SHERIFF TRUMAN shake hands.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
How goes the battle?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Agent Cooper.

MAJOR BRIGGS shakes hands with AGENT COOPER.

COOPER
Major you look bushed.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Well I spent the night obtaining and perusing the Project Blue Book files regarding Windom Earle. I found it impossible to sleep after.

COOPER
What have you gleamed?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Earle was the best and brightest among us. But when our attention turned from outer space to the wooded area surrounding Twin Peaks he became destructively obsessive. Earle acted in an overzealous and secretive manner, possessive of his assignments, finally violent. He was removed from the project. I found this in the project archives.

MAJOR BRIGGS turns around to a nearby television and plays a video. MAJOR BRIGGS steps back. AGENT COOPER and TRUMAN move closer to get a better view. The tape plays a black and white recording of WINDOM EARLE who is dressed in a white coat and is speaking to several people off screen.

WINDOM
These uh, these evil sorcerers uhm, Dugpas they’re called, they uh cultivate evil for - for the sake of evil, nothing else. They uh ... express themselves in darkness for darkness without leveling motive. Uh now this - this ardent purity allows them to access a secret place where the cultivation of evil precedes in exponential fashion and with it the furtherance of evil’s resulting power. This - this place of power is tangible and as such it can be found, entered and perhaps utilized in some fashion. The - the Dugpas have - have many names for them but chief among them ... is the uh is the Black Lodge.

Perturbed, AGENT COOPER looks up to MAJOR BRIGGS.

WINDOM
You don’t believe me do you? You think I’m mad, overworked. Go away.

COOPER presses rewind button on the VCR. As the tape rewinds the image of EARLE on the monitor plays backwards very fast. COOPER exhales a sigh of burden.

COOPER
Gentlemen, when Windom Earle arrived in Twin Peaks I assumed he had come for vengeance, for me. But I miss calculated. He has insinuated himself into the lives of people I care for. He has murdered innocents. He has engaged us in subterfuge and red herring.

COOPER drops his serious demeanor for a moment.

COOPER
A fish I don’t particularly care for.

MAJOR BRIGGS raises his eyebrows in response to COOPER’S odd remark.

COOPER stares at the television.

COOPER
But all of these acts are merely camouflage. He’s been after something else all along, the Black Lodge. Fella’s, we need to find out what this ...

COOPER points to the television monitor.

COOPER
... the Black Lodge has to do with that.

COOPER points to the sketch of the Owl Cave petroglyph on the blackboard.

MUSIC: OWL CAVE


INSERT: OWL CAVE SKETCH

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the Owl Cave petroglyph on the blackboard.


BACK TO SCENE:

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You really believe there’s a connection?

TRUMAN walks towards the blackboard sketch to get a closer look.

COOPER
Windom Earle does Harry.

CAPPY returns to the office. COOPER looks down at the scattering of files on the desktop. COOPER commandingly puts his coffee mug down.

COOPER
Alright, Harry we’re going to go through these files from top to bottom. Cappy, I want you to dig up everything you can about the Dugpas. Major, I think you better hit the sack.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I could use a good stretch. Perhaps a walk in the woods to clear my mind.

MAJOR BRIGGS heads out of the office. TRUMAN pats MAJOR BRIGGS on the shoulder.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Good idea. Don’t forget the bread crumbs.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Right.

AGENT COOPER gives a thumbs up hand sign.

COOPER
Harry, let’s do it.

CLOSE ON: WINDOM EARLE’S RIGHT EAR

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of WINDOM EARLE’S RIGHT EAR where he listens in on the conversation in TRUMAN’S office from the electronic bug implanted on the Banzai tree from which he hears through an earphone speaker.

WINDOM boldly LAUGHS.


BACK TO SCENE:

Dressed in all black, WINDOM removes the earphone speaker. LEO JOHNSON walks by, still wearing pajamas and a robe, carrying firewood.

WINDOM
You know Leo, the only thing that Columbus discovered was that he was lost.

WINDOM LAUGHS.

WINDOM
Cooper and the gang haven’t even left the snide yet.

WINDOM stands up and walks over to his computer.

WINDOM
(chirps) I know something they don’t know. I know something young Dale merely suspects.

WINDOM types a few commands into his briefcase computer that loads a series of images of the Owl Cave petroglyph onto a nearby monitor.

WINDOM
Project Blue Book, little men, pea wits loaded with optimism.

WINDOM CHUCKLES. We PAN SLOWLY LEFT to a monitor which has an enlarged image of the Owl Cave petroglyph.

WINDOM
They were a deterrent so slight it was practically encouragement. Yet I would like to ask Major Briggs a question or three. Polish up that bald nub of his and see what shines.

We continue to PAN LEFT, passing the monitor and a printer until we momentarily FOCUS on a chess set.

WINDOM quickly swipes a hand across the chess set and scatters the chess pieces, knocking them off the board. WINDOM then slaps down two enlarged transparency prints and some other paper onto the cleared chess set board.

We SLOWLY PAN UP.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
Perhaps Leo we too should venture out for a good stretch.

We PAN UP a small pile of thick paperback books and FOCUS on WINDOM’S remote switching device used to trigger the electric shocks, sitting atop the stack of books.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
Wouldn’t it be fun to have a Project Blue Book reunion: ...

LEO walks up to the desk and beside the pile of books. LEO reaches out and quickly, and quietly, grabs the remote device and puts it in the pocket of his robe.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
... wine, cheese, talk about old times, trade hilarious antidotes of the good old days.

We PAN UP.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
I wonder what amongst my detriness I could use to spice up Briggs’ies life.

We FOCUS on LEO’S face as he cautiously stares at WINDOM. LEO looks down at the ground.


LEO’S POV:

Through LEO’S POV we FOCUS on the floor near LEO’S feet where he then lifts his foot to reveal the king chess piece lying on the floor.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
Leo stop doddering.


BACK TO SCENE:

LEO returns his attention to WINDOM.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)

SOUND EFFECT ENDS: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING     2K

We PAN LEFT and FOCUS on a booth in the background where SHELLY JOHNSON and BOBBY BRIGGS, dressed in a dark suit with a yellow tie, sit together. SHELLY reads a written speech out loud.

SHELLY
And that’s the only way we’re ever going to save the trees. Its time to stand up and kick some butt for our environment before its too late for all of us.

Finished with the speech, SHELLY lifts her head and comments.

SHELLY
I’d say its beautiful, letter perfect.

BOBBY lifts his head from its leaning position on the table.

BOBBY
I don’t know about the kick butt part. How about uhm ... fight, its time to stand up and fight for our environment.

SHELLY
Much better.

BOBBY
Shelly, I’ve been thinking.

A bit annoyed, SHELLY rolls her head.

SHELLY
Oh Bobby, I know - I know - I know, the speech counts double.

BOBBY
Forget about the contest. I’ve been thinking about us.

SHELLY
You have?

BOBBY
I know that I have not been paying the right kind of attention to you lately. I got busy with Mr. Horne. I started wearing suits okay. And suddenly I’m walking around like I’m more important then everybody else.

SHELLY
You were pretty crummy.

BOBBY lowers his head.

SHELLY smiles.

SHELLY
Bobby, I’ve missed you.

BOBBY lifts his head back up.

SHELLY
I miss all the things we used to do together.

MUSIC: QUESTIONS IN A WORLD OF BLUE (NO VOCALS)

BOBBY
When I saw you kissing that guy ...

BOBBY takes a deep breath and shakes his head slightly.

BOBBY
... something snapped. It was like ... my brain rolled over and ... I could see all the stuff that was special to me. All the stuff that matters.

BOBBY and SHELLY stare into each other’s eyes.

BOBBY
I love you Shelly. And I want to spend my time with that.

A bit embarrassed, BOBBY lowers his head.

BOBBY
I mean, you know, if that’s okay with you. I’d like to do that either way.

SHELLY smiles, leans over the table and moves close to BOBBY’S face.

SHELLY
Bobby, what do you think?

SHELLY and BOBBY kiss.

A telephone RINGS.

Still close, face-to-face, BOBBY whispers.

BOBBY
Lucky, lucky me.

SHELLY lets off a short, quiet chortle and then kisses BOBBY once more.

HEIDI (OFF SCREEN)
Shelly, telephone! Agent Cooper’s on the line! He need’s to talk to you! Now, Shelly! He says its important!

SHELLY rolls her eyes over the disruption. They break their kiss. SHELLY stands up but before she walks away she bends down and kisses BOBBY once more.

MAYOR MILFORD
I’ve got great news.

LANA
What?

MAYOR MILFORD
Its going to be Norma Jennings and Richard Tremayne. Tremayne is the third judge. Its in the bag.

MAYOR MILFORD lets off a short and distinguished laugh.

LANA
Well now I have to be sure. Baby, I have to be sure I’m going to win.

MAYOR MILFORD
Oh my god this - this guy is uh British or - or Bohemian or something. He’s bound to fall for your charms. We’ll find some way to get you two together alone and then you put on a dress with a slit oh-ho ...

MAYOR MILFORD looks LANA over.

MAYOR MILFORD

MILFORD LAUGHS.

MAYOR MILFORD
And then nestle in real close to him ...

MAYOR MILFORD scoots closer to LANA.

LANA
Okay.

MAYOR MILFORD
... when he gets a look at those ...

MAYOR MILFORD looks down at LANA’S legs.

MAYOR MILFORD

MAYOR MILFORD momentarily lifts his gaze and rolls his eyes in delight. LANA and MAYOR MILFORD stare into each other’s eyes.

MAYOR MILFORD
... and smells that French perfume dripping off you and then ... becomes lost in those ... brown eyes ... oh-ho-ho-ho.

LANA pats several kisses on MAYOR MILFORD’S lips.

MAYOR MILFORD turns away.

MAYOR MILFORD
Oh-ho-ho, stop it. Stop it.

LANA caresses MAYOR MILFORD’S head and continues to plant kisses on his face.

MAYOR MILFORD
Stop it you vixen you. I can’t stand it anymore. Why can’t we just elope and - and ...

LANA backs away.

LANA
No. Now not until I’ve won darlin’.

MAYOR MILFORD
Oh-ho-ho.

LANA
Then, and only then, I will marry you.

MAYOR MILFORD
Oh-ho-ho. Oh you’re so strict darling. But I am the blasted heir.

LANA puts her arm around MAYOR MILFORD and pulls him close to her for a hug.

Oh baby, come here. Its okay.

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - DAY

In an interrogation room of the building, we get a bird’s-eye view from above looking down upon AGENT COOPER, AUDREY, DONNA and SHELLY as they sit together around a small square table. Laid out on the table in front of COOPER are the three torn strips of the poem given separately to AUDREY, DONNA and SHELLY. We ZOOM IN.

COOPER
Each of you received a piece of this poem, each in a curious manner, along with this invitation.

COOPER picks up the invitation card.

AUDREY
We all went to the Roadhouse. Nobody showed up.

We PAN and FOCUS on DONNA.

DONNA
There was this strange guy who said he was a friend of my father’s.

We PAN LEFT and FOCUS on SHELLY.

SHELLY
The same day I got the poem I got a ten dollar tip for a cup of coffee. That’s unusual.

We PAN RIGHT slightly and FOCUS on AUDREY.

AUDREY
There was a funny old guy at the library who asked me to read the poem to him.

We PAN RIGHT and FOCUS on AGENT COOPER.

Surprised, SHELLY looks up to COOPER

SHELLY
Its Leo’s.

We FOCUS tightly on COOPER but as he talks we PAN RIGHT to move behind him.

COOPER
Listen carefully, I want each of you to check in with the sheriff twice a day: nine o’clock in the morning, nine o’clock at night.

We continue to PAN RIGHT and momentarily FOCUS on DONNA.

COOPER
I want your parents to know your whereabouts at all times.

We PAN LEFT to momentarily FOCUS on AUDREY.

COOPER
If you walk to school? If you drive to work? Make sure that you don’t do so alone.

We PAN LEFT and once again move behind COOPER as we PAN to FOCUS on SHELLY.

COOPER
Please believe me when I tell you to be very careful. You’re in danger. We all are.

We FOLLOW ON LEO as he continues to wipe away sawdust.

WINDOM (OFF SCREEN)
Rather like the Kali worshippers in India. Another fine bunch of zannies I can tell you. Blood for breakfast, blood for lunch.

WINDOM LAUGHS again. LEO stares at the collection of queen cards with the head shot images of AUDREY, DONNA and SHELLY pinned to a ceiling joist.

WINDOM puts the crossbow down and clasps his hands together.

WINDOM
But no matter, she’s still fit for a queen.

LEO continues to stare at the card.

WINDOM
Would you mourn her passing Leo? I doubt it.

WINDOM stands up and walks towards LEO.

WINDOM
Her death Leo, Shelly’s emanate demise, its very simple really.

WINDOM stands a short distance from LEO.

WINDOM
Shelly wins Miss Twin Peaks ...

WINDOM waves his right hand and SNAPS his fingers.

WINDOM

WINDOM waves his left hand and SNAPS his fingers.

We FOCUS on LEO has he continues to stare at SHELLY’S card.

WINDOM
No Leo, I’m begging you.

WINDOM puts his hands together in a praying fashion.

WINDOM
Have pity, have mercy Leo.

LEO
I love Shelly.

LEO presses the button on the remote and the electric shock collar around his neck come to life sending crackling high voltages of pain into his body.

LEO
Agghhhh!

LEO releases the button and the shocks stop. LEO stares at the remote and at his hands in confusion. LEO points the remote at WINDOM once more and pushes the button. Once again, the shocking pain strikes at LEO’S collar.

LEO
Agghhhh!

A bit amused WINDOM walks towards LEO.

The pain is so great that it knocks LEO down backwards to the floor. Shaking in agony on the floor, LEO releases the button.

WINDOM LAUGHS in perverse joy over LEO’S confused, self-inflicted torment.

In desperation, LEO pushes the button one last time.

LEO
AGGHHHHH!!!

LEO shakes in piercing pain on the floor.

WINDOM continues to LAUGH. LEO finally releases the button on the remote. WINDOM walks over to a nearby shelf and grabs a pair of lockable metal restraints.

WINDOM
Poor Leo.

LEO MOANS in pain on the floor. WINDOM walks up to LEO.

WINDOM
We are all love’s fools more or less. But you will learn as I have the value of ...

BEN and AUDREY pat a kiss on the lips in greeting.

AUDREY
I got back this morning but Agent Cooper needed to see me, so.

AUDREY puts her purse on top of BEN’S desk.

BENJAMIN
Something’s wrong?

AUDREY removes her checkered black and white jacket and holds it folded on her arm.

AUDREY
Some creep sent me a poem. Uhm, I tried to call Jack’s room but he wasn’t there. Do you know where he is?

BEN waves a finger at AUDREY and then paces the floor in front of her.

BENJAMIN
Audrey, while you were gone, ...

BEN stands still in front of AUDREY.

BENJAMIN
... I had the most incredible brain storm.

AUDREY
What?

BENJAMIN
The Stop Ghostwood movement needs a spokesperson. Someone with a highly visible profile to be able to inspire our community to action, hmm.

AUDREY
Daddy, where’s Jack?

BENJAMIN
You can do it Audrey. As Miss Twin Peaks you could be that spokesperson ...

AUDREY LAUGHS.

AUDREY
Oh god.

BENJAMIN
... and you could use your public platform ...

AUDREY
No, dad.

BENJAMIN
... as a forum for environmental debate.

BENJAMIN grabs AUDREY’S upper arms.

BENJAMIN
Audrey listen, you can do it. Only you can take our message to the people.

AUDREY
Daddy, where is John Justice Wheeler?

BENJAMIN closes his eyes.

BENJAMIN
He’s gone.

AUDREY
Where’d he go?

BENJAMIN turns to his desk and leans over it.

BENJAMIN
Some tragedy in Brazil demanded his immediate attention.

Bending over his desk, BENJAMIN reaches for a letter.

BENJAMIN
He left a letter for you. I have it here somewhere.

AUDREY
Daddy?

BENJAMIN finds the letter and hands it to AUDREY. Slightly upset, AUDREY scans the front of the letter before turning back to her father.

AUDREY
When did he leave?

BENJAMIN
A few minutes ago, the airport.

AUDREY rushes off to the door of the office.

BENJAMIN
Audrey?! What about Miss Twin Peaks?

Standing in the doorway, AUDREY turns to BENJAMIN.

AUDREY
Daddy I’ll talk with you about this later okay.

BENJAMIN moves toward AUDREY, pleading with his arms held out.

AUDREY quickly walks up to PETE. PETE turns to AUDREY.

AUDREY
Do you have a car?

PETE
A truck, runs like a dream.

AUDREY
Great lets go.

AUDREY grabs PETE’S hand and leads him out of the lobby. Surprised, PETE quietly follows AUDREY.

PETE
Wait.

PETE removes himself of AUDREY’S grip so that he can retrieve his hat. A MAN seated in a chair with his feet resting on a table cuts off PETE’S access to his hat sitting on an endtable.

PETE
Beg your pardon sir.

The MAN lowers his legs so that PETE can pass and grab his hat. PETE puts his hat on and then stares back up at the painting above the fireplace. AUDREY walks up to PETE and grabs his arm.

We FOCUS on the sketch of the Owl Cave map on the blackboard. We ZOOM OUT. DEPUTY ANDY walks up to the blackboard and looks it over. SHERIFF TRUMAN walks around the desk in his office.

COOPER
Well the symbols suggest a time. Seems clear.

TRUMAN takes a seat on the edge of his desk and faces the sketch.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
A time for what?

We view the entire office. AGENT COOPER also sits atop TRUMAN’S desk on the opposite corner.

COOPER
I don’t know. First I thought it was a signpost. Perhaps its an invitation.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Or both?

COOPER
Hmm. Where’s the Major?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He should be here by now. Andy, give Mrs. Briggs a call. See if the Major’s home yet.

DEPUTY ANDY leaves the room.

MUSIC ENDS: OWL CAVE

AGENT COOPER walks up to the closed blinds of TRUMAN’S office window. Birds can be heard cheerfully CHIRPING outside. COOPER spreads a gap in the horizontal blinds with his right hand to get a view outside. As COOPER peers outside, TRUMAN diverts his attention from the Owl Cave map sketch and notices COOPER’S distraction.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What is it Coop?

COOPER
Oh just thinking about Annie Blackburn.

TRUMAN smiles.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well bless your heart. I’ve never known your mind to wander.

COOPER
Oh Harry I’ve been feeling this way all day. You know, I proceed as usual, my mind clear and focused, ...

COOPER removes his hand from propping the gap in the blinds.

COOPER
... then suddenly out of nowhere I see her face and I hear her voice.

For a moment TRUMAN lowers his head as he remembers his lost love.

COOPER turns to TRUMAN.

COOPER
Naturally I try to reorient myself, come back to the task at hand, but the image remains. Sometimes I actually feel dizzy.

COOPER smiles giddily. TRUMAN grins at COOPER’S response.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Man in love supposed to feel that way.

TRUMAN reverts to thinking about JOSIE.

COOPER
Well my symptoms suggest the onset of malaria but I’ve never felt better in my life.

COOPER drops his smile and turns back to the window.

COOPER
I’m sorry Harry, that sounds foolish.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
No, no man ... it sounds lucky.

Once again, COOPER props open a gap in the horizontal blinds with his right hand and looks outside.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Hmm.

Suddenly the MAJOR senses something and moves his right hand to the back of his head behind his right ear.

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of a reddish-brown scar of three triangles joined at one point at the back of MAJOR’S BRIGGS neck behind his right ear. MAJOR BRIGGS touches the scar.

We ZOOM OUT. MAJOR BRIGGS turns around.

Singing Home On The Range, WINDOM EARLE and LEO JOHNSON walk in tandem towards MAJOR BRIGGS concealed within a black and white horse costume.

WINDOM
Oh home on the range.
Where the deer and the antelope play.

MAJOR BRIGGS stands silently, confused by the approaching horse costume.

WINDOM
Where seldom is heard.
A discouraging word ...

WINDOM and LEO, still concealed in the horse costume, stop right in front of MAJOR BRIGGS.

WINDOM
Hello Wilbur!

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS

WINDOM opens the front of the costume, right below the horse’s head, and sticks out his right hand brandishing a dart gun. WINDOM quickly aims the dart gun at MAJOR BRIGGS and fires it.

A dart hits MAJOR BRIGGS in the chest. In shock, MAJOR BRIGGS looks down at the dart protruding from his chest before quickly pulling it out. Stunned, MAJOR BRIGGS looks at the dart in his hand.

MUSIC ENDS: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS

WINDOM
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

MAJOR BRIGGS begins to tremble as the drug takes affect. MAJOR BRIGGS looks at the horse costume and realizes its WINDOM EARLE in disguise but he is now powerless to react.

WINDOM HUMS the rest of the song he had been SINGING.

Under the growing effects of the dart’s drug, MAJOR BRIGGS stumbles and falls to the ground on his back.

WINDOM
Long time no see Briggsie!

MAJOR BRIGGS points and murmurs his distress at WINDOM.

WINDOM removes the costume’s horse head and throws it to the ground. WINDOM turns to the back end of the horse.

WINDOM

MAJOR BRIGGS finally succumbs to the drug and collapses flat on the ground.

WINDOM revels in the moment by LAUGHING in sheer ecstasy.

ANNIE wipes the counter and places the dirty towel onto the leaflet and crumples the mess together to throw it out. AGENT COOPER steps up to the counter, reaches out and holds ANNIE’S hand.

COOPER
Couldn’t hurt to give it a shot.

We PAN UP to view ANNIE’S bright eyes and smile as she speaks to COOPER.

ANNIE
Maybe next year.

COOPER points at ANNIE, You’ve got it.

ANNIE
Coffee?

COOPER
You bet.

ANNIE walks off to the coffee station near the short order window at the back of the diner. COOPER spins around on his stool.

As COOPER stares at the counter, ANNIE returns with a coffee cup, a pot of coffee and a silverware set. ANNIE lays out the silverware on a napkin and slides it over in front of COOPER.

ANNIE
Something’s troubling you?

ANNIE pours a cup of coffee.

We VERY SLOWLY begin to ZOOM OUT.

COOPER
Yes.

ANNIE
Would you like to talk about it?

COOPER
Annie I’m involved in a very complicated investigation requiring my complete attention. Yet I spend most of my time thinking of you.

The bell to the front door RINGS as a CUSTOMER exits the diner.

ANNIE
I know the feeling. I’ve been seeing your face in fried eggs all this morning.

ANNIE and COOPER LAUGH. COOPER grabs his cup of coffee.

COOPER
You know there are those who believe in a scientific bases for attraction, its a chemical.

COOPER takes a sip of coffee.

ANNIE
Is that what it is?

Another WAITRESS walks by and goes into the kitchen.

COOPER
I don’t know. Hard to comprehend without perspective.

COOPER puts his coffee cup down.

ANNIE
Yeah, I spent five years trying to comprehend it.

ANNIE lets off a nervous CHUCKLE.

COOPER

Recognizing the quote, COOPER SLAPS the countertop.

COOPER

ANNIE nods her head, You’ve got it.

COOPER picks up his coffee cup and takes a sip.

ANNIE
Maybe we should go bowling?

The WAITRESS walks away from the short order window with a plate of food.

COOPER
How about dancing?

ANNIE
I don’t know how.

COOPER puts his cup down and stands up.

COOPER
I’ll teach you, its easy.

ANNIE
When?

COOPER
Tonight.

We STOP ZOOMING OUT. We can now view a good portion of the interior of the diner. Now in the distance, COOPER and ANNIE stare into each other’s eyes. COOPER and ANNIE lean over the counter to kiss.


CLOSE ON: ANNIE and COOPER

We view a CLOSE-UP of ANNIE and COOPER as they lean close together over the island counter, kissing. COOPER backs from the kiss and, belated, looks around the diner to check if anybody is gawking at them. With the coast clear, COOPER resumes kissing ANNIE.

The sound of BREAKING GLASS disrupts ANNIE’S and COOPER’S kiss. COOPER leans farther over the island counter to view the source of the noise.

JOHN spreads his arms out as AUDREY rushes up to him. They embrace each other, pull away and then kiss deeply.

Teary eyed, AUDREY looks into JOHN’S eyes.

With only one foot on the ground, MAJOR BRIGGS, dressed in his usual Air Force uniform, lies tied to a large archery shooting target against a wall of rectangular hay bales that line the back of the cabin wall. Standing a distance away, WINDOM EARLE, dressed in all black, loads an arrow into his small crossbow.

WINDOM
When did you first see the symbol in Owl Cave?

WINDOM feels the point of the sharp arrow.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I’m not at liberty to divulge that information.

WINDOM points the crossbow towards MAJOR BRIGGS.

WINDOM
Oh - ho - ho, cheater.

LEO, still wearing his red robe, stands next to WINDOM. WINDOM aims the crossbow and fires.

Scaring MAJOR BRIGGS, the arrow hits the wall just a few inches away from his head.

LEO hands WINDOM another arrow. WINDOM bends down as he pulls back the tension string.

WINDOM
What does the cave painting mean?

WINDOM installs the arrow into the crossbow.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I’m not at liberty to divulge that information.

With the crossbow pointed at MAJOR BRIGGS, WINDOM looks at LEO.

WINDOM
Damn but I love the military mind.

Without aiming or even looking at MAJOR BRIGGS, WINDOM pulls the trigger and fires the arrow.

The arrow lands right beside MAJOR BRIGGS ribs on his right side, close enough for the MAJOR to GRUNT.

WINDOM puts the crossbow down and walks up to MAJOR BRIGGS.

WINDOM
What is the capital of North Carolina?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Raleigh.

WINDOM turns around.

WINDOM
Fat lot of good that’ll do me.

WINDOM reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a hypodermic syringe and a vial.

WINDOM
Major, I admire your fortitude.

WINDOM
However, ...

While he backs up towards MAJOR BRIGGS, WINDOM taps the syringe to remove air bubbles.

WINDOM

WINDOM viciously plunges the needle into MAJOR BRIGGS’ chest and injects its contents.

WINDOM turns towards LEO. WINDOM mocks throwing the hypodermic syringe like a dart towards LEO.

WINDOM
Catch.

Scared to death, LEO quickly scrambles backward.

WINDOM GIGGLES in delight. Still smiling at LEO, WINDOM puts the syringe back into this coat pocket and brushes his hands. WINDOM spins to MAJOR BRIGGS and salutes him.

WINDOM
Your name please?

LEO walks back out of his defensive position.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Garland Briggs.

WINDOM stands right next to MAJOR BRIGGS.

WINDOM
Garland, what do you fear most in the world.

MAJOR BRIGGS
The possibility that ... love is not enough.

WINDOM LAUGHS.

WINDOM
Oh Garland please, I shall weep.

WINDOM points at MAJOR BRIGGS as he asks the next question.

WINDOM
How much does your wife weigh?

As the drug takes effect, MAJOR BRIGGS begins to move his head back and forth.

MAJOR BRIGGS
One-hundred fifteen pounds.

WINDOM
Ooh, good for her.

WINDOM touches MAJOR BRIGGS’ face and waves his right hand about in a S formation, signifying feminine curves. Again, WINDOM points at MAJOR BRIGGS as he asks the next question.

WINDOM
Now, when did you first see the petroglyph in Owl Cave?

LEO moves a bit closer.

MAJOR BRIGGS
In ... in dreams.

WINDOM
What kind of dreams?

MAJOR BRIGGS
I was night fishing with ... Agent Cooper. There was a light ... a guardian beyond it. I was taken ... but my mind ... still I recognized the signs.

WINDOM
What do the signs mean?

MAJOR BRIGGS
There’s a time ... if Jupiter and Saturn meet ... they will receive you.

MAJOR BRIGGS uncontrollably begins to speak.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Tat - mok - nuie - neya - nemok - nea ...

WINDOM gently slaps MAJOR BRIGGS’ face.

WINDOM
Garland? Garland?

LEO still watches cautiously from a distance.

WINDOM
Garland? Garland, I ... I was hoping for a lengthy conversation. Leo, put the Major to bed.

LEO walks up to MAJOR BRIGGS and removes the binds that hold him up against the wall.

WINDOM
I’m afraid his mind has begun to wander.

WINDOM walks away as he gathers what MAJOR BRIGGS has revealed.

ANDREW pushes the new moon at Aries, the full moon at Libra and the half moon at Cancer.


BACK TO SCENE:

A compartment at the bottom of the puzzle box SPRINGS open.

ANDREW
Ah!

CATHERINE
Give that to me.

CATHERINE grabs the box.

ANDREW YELLS his excitement in CATHERINE’S ear.

ANDREW
Ha - ha! Ahh!

CATHERINE slides open the bottom compartment of the puzzle box to reveal another black puzzle box. CATHERINE lifts the smaller box up and examines it.

CATHERINE
Oh what a bore.

ANDREW
I opened it.

ANDREW grabs the smaller puzzle box, puts it on the table, grabs the rolling pin and, with both hands, lifts the rolling pin over his head. As ANDREW swings the rolling pin down we are left FOCUSING on a mounted mountain goat’s head trophy hanging on the wall.


INSERT: SMALL PUZZLE BOX

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the small puzzle box as the rolling pin swings down and shatters it into pieces.

CATHERINE (OFF SCREEN)
Ahh!

We PAN LEFT and survey the interior. A large sign centered above the stage reads, "Miss Twin Peaks, 20th Anniversary." While several COUPLES slow dance on the floor, WORKERS continue to put the finishing touches on the stage.

WORKER #1
Okay take that uh table down.

WORKER #2
I’m thirsty.

WORKER #1
I am too. Its hot in here.

We continue to PAN LEFT. Several WAITRESSES walk by with platters of drink orders.

We PAN LEFT until we FOCUS on ANNIE and then ZOOM IN on her face. ANNIE, in a blue dress, sits at the bar facing the dance floor.


ANNIE’S POV:

Through ANNIE’S POV we view the dancing COUPLES on the dance floor. In the background, AGENT COOPER slowly makes his way forward. Dressed in a dark suit, COOPER stands, with his hands in his pants pockets, a distance away and smiles.


BACK TO SCENE:

Tight lipped, ANNIE smiles.


ANNIE’S POV:

Through ANNIE’S POV, COOPER extends his right hand for her to come join him on the dance floor.


BACK TO SCENE:

A bit embarrassed, ANNIE head motions slightly for no.


ANNIE’S POV:

Through ANNIE’S POV, COOPER, a bit dejected, puts his hands back in his pants pocket and waits for ANNIE to join him on the dance floor.


BACK TO SCENE:

Though smiling, ANNIE nervously eyes the dancing COUPLES and remains seated.


ANNIE’S POV:

Through ANNIE’S POV, COOPER, a bit impatient, motions with a hand wave for her to join him on the dance floor.


BACK TO SCENE:

ANNIE gets up from her stool at the bar and walks over to COOPER.

COOPER smiles as ANNIE finally makes her way towards him. 

In the background, WORKERS arrange the stage and setup the microphone.

COOPER and ANNIE hold hands as they meet on the dance floor.

ANNIE
I’m not completely prepared for this.

COOPER
Just think of it as a walking embrace, alright.

COOPER puts his right hand on ANNIE’S back and extends his left hand, gripping ANNIE’S hand, outward.

COOPER
Two people stepping as one would step.

COOPER and ANNIE begin to dance, moving together slowly while turning in place.

ANNIE
So far so good.

COOPER LAUGHS a little.

COOPER
Just follow me.

ANNIE
We’ll follow each other.

COOPER
Mm-hmm. That’s good.

ANNIE
Its genetic memory. Mom and dad danced the Lindy.

ANNIE moves a little closer to COOPER, leaning on him.

COOPER
You got it.

COOPER closes his eyes as they dance, leaning on each other.

COOPER
Your body feels nice against mine.

ANNIE
I’m just thinking the same thing.

COOPER pulls back slightly.

COOPER
Listen, if I’m being too forward ...

ANNIE quiets COOPER by kissing him.

ANNIE
I want more than your kisses.

COOPER
For instance?

ANNIE
I want ...

Testing the microphone on the stage, MAYOR MILFORD’S voice BOOMS from the speaker system disrupting ANNIE’S intimate discussion with COOPER.

MAYOR MILFORD
Is this thing on?

The dance music is cut off by a SWIPE of the needle off of a vinyl record player.

MUSIC ENDS: QUESTIONS IN A WORLD OF BLUE (PIANO & SAX VARIANT; NO VOCALS)     144K

Distortion WHINES out from the sound system.

MAYOR MILFORD
Welcome to this final night of festivities celebrating the Miss Twin Peaks ...

The microphone nearly cuts out.

COOPER, ANNIE and the COUPLES on the dance floor strain to hear MAYOR MILFORD speak.

MAYOR MILFORD
... pageant. As some of you ...

Frustrated, MAYOR MILFORD looks at the microphone.

MAYOR MILFORD
... damnation. Is this damn thing on?!

A WORKER who had been setting up the microphone rushes onto the stage and immediately starts to adjust the height of the microphone.

The dance music is turned back on.

MUSIC: QUESTIONS IN A WORLD OF BLUE (PIANO & SAX VARIANT; NO VOCALS)     144K

In the background, COUPLES return to dancing.

While ANNIE looks at MAYOR MILFORD on the stage we ZOOM IN on her face as she speaks to COOPER.

ANNIE
What I mean is, I - I understand why you hesitate, why you treat me with care. The convent evokes the image of helpless women fearful of the thought of any emotion other than those derived from scripture and prayer but when you hold me, when we kiss, I feel safe and eager.

ANNIE turns to COOPER.

ANNIE
I’m not afraid of anything you make me feel or want.

ANNIE and COOPER gently lean towards each other and kiss. But, with a RING of distortion, the kiss is held short as MAYOR MILFORD again disrupts them as he tests the sound system.

MAYOR MILFORD
Is this on? Eh? Is this on?

COOPER
I’m beginning to tire of his interruptions.

MAYOR MILFORD (OFF SCREEN)
Welcome to ...

ANNIE
I don’t know, I think he’s cute.

ANNIE looks towards the MAYOR.

MAYOR MILFORD (OFF SCREEN)
... this final night ...

COOPER
You do huh?

COOPER follows ANNIE’S gaze towards the MAYOR.

MAYOR MILFORD
... of festivities.

The MAYOR is unable to continue his speech as the telescoping stand of the microphone slowly begins to slide down. MAYOR MILFORD bends down with the microphone as it descends.

ANNIE
I think that maybe I will enter after all.

COOPER
The Miss Twin Peaks contest?

ANNIE
Why not? Hear the other side, see the other side.

Reciting COOPER’S quote from the diner, ANNIE smiles and points at him.

ANNIE
There’s worst places to start than Miss Twin Peaks. Its like a fairy tale.

COOPER
And you’re the queen.

COOPER brushes his left hand along ANNIE’S cheek.

The room falls dark and a spotlight falls on COOPER. COOPER looks towards the stage.

MUSIC ENDS: QUESTIONS IN A WORLD OF BLUE (PIANO & SAX VARIANT; NO VOCALS)     144K

On the stage, MAYOR MILFORD taps at the microphone. The stage falls dark.

SOUND EFFECT: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING     2K

As the last scene FADES OUT, we FADE IN on a CLOSE-UP of the front end of PETE’S powder blue pick-up truck. We PAN UP. PETE is sleeping, and SNORING a little, behind the wheel of his parked truck.

The ROAR of a jet rouses PETE out of his slumber but the flash of the jet’s headlights brightening his window scares him. Mistakenly fearing a crash, PETE thrusts his arms out towards the window.

PETE is caught by surprise and does a double take of looking towards the jet and back to AUDREY.

Teary eyed, AUDREY stands with her arms crossed as she watches the jet fly off.

AUDREY
What a gyp. I finally meet the man of my dreams the next thing I know he’s on a plane to Brazil.

PETE shakes his head from side-to-side.

PETE
He’ll be back one day. He promised.

AUDREY
Yeah. He also promised to take me fishing and we never did.

PETE’S interest is piqued.

AUDREY
Love stinks.

PETE
Fishing?

AUDREY
Yeah, Pearl Lake or something.

PETE
I have some tackle in the truck.

AUDREY
You do?

PETE
Audrey, ...


AUDREY’S POV:

Through AUDREY’S POV the jet appears smaller as it flies away into the distance.

PETE (OFF SCREEN)
... there are many cures for a broken heart ...


BACK TO SCENE:

PETE
... but nothing quite like a trout’s leap in the moonlight.

PETE extends his right arm for AUDREY to lean on.

PETE
May I?

AUDREY looks at PETE and GIGGLES before smiling brightly.

AUDREY
You may.

WINDOM
For you see, the cave painting is not only an invitation ...

Illuminating a spot of light on a pine tree in the background, a spotlight is cast just above the circle of stones.

A hand, lit by the spotlight, juts out of thin air right above the circle of stones. The whole right arm now juts out of thin air. The hand shakes, twists and feels its way out in the open air.

Its BOB, the man with the dirty gray hair and the jean jacket. BOB, contorting his hand in a spotlight, has now fully materialized.

BOB pulls his arm out of the spotlight and GROWLS.
