INT. LOG LADY’S CABIN - DAY

MUSIC: CALL OF THE BLACK LODGE     272K

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, ‘LOG LADY’ MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.

LOG LADY
Miscommunication sometimes leads to arguments and arguments sometimes lead to fights. Anger is usually present in arguments and fights. Anger is an emotion, usually classified as a negative emotion. Negative emotions can cause severe problems in our environment and to the health of our body. Happiness, usually classified as a positive emotion, can bring good health to our body and spread positive vibrations into our environment. Sometimes when we are ill we are not on our best behavior. By ill, I mean any of the following: physically ill, emotionally ill, mentally ill, and / or spiritually ill.

INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY


LELAND’S POV:

SOUND EFFECT: SCREAM

Our view opens up to a cavernous dark hole from which we spirally withdraw from as we hear the blood curdling scream from a woman. As we continue to fall back we can also hear a hospital heart signature machine rhythmically beep along with the voice of a young girl that says ‘daddy.’ Our view still rotates as we back up and exit the cave to see a multitude of holes.

We retreat further and see that we were looking at an extreme closeup of a sound proofing tile on the wall. We back up further and continue to hear the screams of a woman and the voice of a young girl say ‘daddy’.

SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN steps into view from the right. The heart machine beeps faster and faster until it flatlines and becomes a tone.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leland.


BACK TO SCENE:

Our view ROTATES as we look at LELAND PALMER’S face. The rotation stops. Seated in a chair, LELAND is starring at the wall as SHERIFF TRUMAN tries to get his attention.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leland. Leland.

LELAND finally snaps out of it and acknowledges by blinking his eyes.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You have the right to an attorney.

FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER stands in the background. LELAND nods his head for no.

LELAND
I wave that right.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I'm going to ask you some questions. Anything you say may be held against you in a court of law. Do you understand?

LELAND
Yes, of course I do.

FAVORING ON LELAND, we move to PAN the room.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
On Friday morning, March 3rd, did you go to Calhoun Memorial Hospital?

LELAND
Yes.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Why did you go there?

LELAND
I was looking for someone.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Who were you looking for?

In the background, DR. WILL HAYWARD leans against the wall by the door.

LELAND
The man who killed my daughter.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Did you know his name?

LELAND
No. Yes, I do now. Jacques Renault.

TRUMAN leans down to face LELAND.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What ... made you think he killed Laura?

LELAND
You arrested him.

TRUMAN sternly looks at LELAND and then to the ground. COOPER bows his head.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leland, did you kill Jacques Renault?

LELAND
He killed my Laura.

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME (SLOW VARIANT)

LELAND
Have you ever experienced absolute loss?

COOPER
(gently) I doubt that any one of us is a stranger to grief.

LELAND
More than grief. Its deep down ... inside. Every cell screams. You can hear ... nothing else.

LELAND’S eyes water as he speaks with a cry in his voice.

LELAND
Yes, I killed ... I killed him. Yes.

Upset, LELAND thrusts forward his hands in fists.

LELAND
(grunts) Yes, yes.

SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at COOPER, who still has his head bowed.

MUSIC ENDS: LAURA PALMER’S THEME (SLOW VARIANT)




CUT TO:

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - DAY

AGENT COOPER, in his usual suit, and DR. HAYWARD, wearing a coat and carrying his medical bag, walk up the hall and enter the reception area. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN is going through the magazines on an endtable in the reception area.

COOPER
He’ll plead temporary insanity.

DR. HAYWARD
We’ll need a psychiatric exam. I’ll tell you one thing, parents should not bury their children. Anyone who’s been through what Leland has has ...

COOPER stops walking and turns to DR. HAYWARD.

COOPER
You approve of murder Dr. Hayward?

DR. HAYWARD
No.

COOPER quietly turns around and continues to walk to the adjoining hallway. DR. HAYWARD watches COOPER walk off.

ANDY
Hey doc.

DR. HAYWARD turns around.

DR. HAYWARD
How are you Andy?

ANDY
Fine. Great. Fine.

ANDY clearly appears agitated.

DR. HAYWARD
What’s the problem?

ANDY
Its kinda’ personal.

DR. HAYWARD
I’m your doctor Andy.

ANDY
Its about my sperms ... (whispered) test.

DR. HAYWARD
Yes.

Embarrassed, ANDY becomes more agitated.

ANDY
You know. I flunked.

DR. HAYWARD
That’s not the precise term for it.

ANDY
Well, I was just wondering if its the kind of test you can take over. You know like uhm ... a driver’s exam. I mean, I’ve been wearing boxer shorts everyday just like you told me.

DR. HAYWARD
You want to give it another shot?

ANDY
Yes sir I would.

DR. HAYWARD places his bag on top of the planter between himself and ANDY and digs into the medical bag.

DR. HAYWARD
I’ll need to take a sample ... with me.

DR. HAYWARD hands ANDY a small glass vial.

ANDY
Right now?

DR. HAYWARD
Put it in a brown bag. I’ll wait in the car.

DR. HAYWARD closes his bag and walks off. ANDY, perturbed, looks at the glass vial.

MUSIC: ANDY’S THEME   7K

Holding a rolled up magazine, ANDY nervously peers out into the hallway from behind the door to the conference room. ANDY checks both directions and all appears clear so he rushes out and around the corner but smashes head on into LUCY MORAN, who just stepped out of a room and into the hall. LUCY, carrying a box full of ground coffee packets, falls to the floor dropping the box and scattering the packets all over the floor. ANDY dropped the magazine he was carrying and it is lost somewhere underneath the packets.

Nervously, ANDY helps LUCY pick up the packets and put them back in the box hoping to get his magazine before she sees it. Unfortunately for ANDY, LUCY finds it first. LUCY picks up the magazine and notices that it is a Fleshworld magazine. LUCY stares at ANDY in disbelief. A toilet can be heard FLUSHING nearby and LUCY looks at a door just behind ANDY.


LUCY’S POV:

From LUCY’S POV we view a CLOSE-UP on the sign of the door:

REST ROOM


BACK TO SCENE:

LUCY makes the correct assumption between the magazine and the restroom. LUCY glares at ANDY and thrusts the magazine towards him. Embarrassed, ANDY grabs the magazine. LUCY picks up her box and walks away. Before she goes around the corner LUCY lets out a SNOOT.

MUSIC ENDS: ANDY’S THEME   7K

LUCY walks into her reception office and slams a clipboard on her desk. SHERIFF TRUMAN, sitting in the reception area, turns around to see the commotion. A DEPUTY calls in a report over LUCY’S police radio.

DEPUTY (OFF SCREEN)
Lucy, I got a garbage truck here on ...

LUCY
Oh shut up.

TRUMAN turns back around to face AGENT COOPER. LUCY slams a handfull of files on a table in her office.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Our judge arrives this afternoon, Clinton Sternwood. Travels the circuit in a Winnebago.

COOPER sourly looks at LUCY as he digs into his coat pocket.

COOPER
Outdoors enthusiast?

COOPER enters the judge’s name into his electronic notebook, a small calculator-like device.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Last of frontiersmen. They broke the mold.

COOPER checks his electronic notebook.

COOPER
Well we got bail hearing for Leland and Leo’s competency examination.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Will Leland get bail?

COOPER
Well Harry that’s up to your state prosecutor.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That’d be Daryl Lodwick. Also on his way.

COOPER enters the prosecutor’s name into his electronic notebook.

COOPER
When do we hear from Hawk?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He called this morning.

TRUMAN puts his coffee mug on the nearby planter and pulls a folded piece of paper out of his shirt pocket.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Now the county ... says nobody by the name Robertson ever lived next to the Palmer’s. We’ve got a current address on the last occupants, Kalispell.

DEPUTY BOB, whistling, enters the building.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We’ll check it by afternoon.

DEPUTY BOB, holding an open folder in front of his face, walks into the hallway. Out of view, we hear DEPUTY BOB collide with someone.

DEPUTY BOB (OFF SCREEN)
Hey. Watch it Andy.

COOPER turns his head towards the sound of the collision. COOPER puts his electronic notebook back in his coat pocket.

MUSIC: ANDY’S THEME   7K

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
Sorry Bob.

COOPER sees a small glass vial roll on the floor to a corner of the room, below a chair.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
Oh my god.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, AGENT COOPER and LUCY all look at ANDY as he walks into the reception area. ANDY scans the floor for his glass vial. ANDY quickly moves to the corner of the room and gets on his knees to look under the chair. COOPER notices the soles of ANDY’S boots.

COOPER
Andy don’t move.

SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at COOPER.

MUSIC ENDS: ANDY’S THEME   7K

COOPER
Where did you get those?

Still on his knees and with his head under the chair, ANDY replies ...

ANDY
Don’t make me say where these came from.

COOPER
Andy.

ANDY pulls his head out from underneath the chair and looks at COOPER.

ANDY
Please Agent Cooper this is extremely personal business.

COOPER gives ANDY a puzzled look.

COOPER
Your boots?

ANDY looks at his boots and then to COOPER.

ANDY
Oh, I’m sorry. I bought these from Philip Gerard yesterday when he was waiting. Sorry.

COOPER looks at TRUMAN then kneels down to get a closer look at the heel of the boot.

COOPER
These are the same brand of boots ...


COOPER’S POV:

From COOPER’S POV we FOCUS on the heel of the boot. The heel is marked:

Circle Brand

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
... we found at Leo Johnson’s.


BACK TO SCENE:

COOPER
The giant said there was a clue out there.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
But I thought it was the cocaine?

COOPER
Harry we’ve got to find Philip Gerard, the one-armed man.

ANDY, still on his knees, looks at COOPER.

ANDY
Can I go now, Agent Cooper? I don’t know how much time I’ve got.

COOPER
If you must.

ANDY stands up and quickly runs outside. LUCY watches ANDY as he leaves the building. COOPER notices LUCY.

COOPER
Harry, what’s with Lucy?

LUCY looks at her pencil and then tosses it behind her. LUCY reaches for another pencil and then returns to her work.

In a hallway of the hotel, LOUIS, a desk clerk, meets BENJAMIN HORNE.

LOUIS
Mr. Horne.

BENJAMIN
Walk and talk with me.

BEN and LOUIS walk up the hallway together. LOUIS speaks very quickly.

LOUIS
Okay, so this scribe inline works for the Seattle Prodispatch.

BENJAMIN
Right.

LOUIS
Actually my sister went to college with her but she’s kind of a friend of mine to her.

BEN gestures to LOUIS to get to the point.

BENJAMIN
To which.

LOUIS
Anyway, she called me this morning with a hot tip.

BENJAMIN
Mm-hmm.

LOUIS
Top secret.

BEN checks his watch.

LOUIS
M. T. Went is coming to Twin Peaks.

BEN and LOUIS are now in the lobby which is bristling with people. A sign, surrounded with balloons, above a doorway reads:

Welcome
??? County Lumber
Queen Semifinals

Rubbing his hands together, BEN mulls the name over.

BENJAMIN
M. T. Wents? M. T. Wents?

LOUIS
M. T. Wents, the travel writer.

BENJAMIN
Yes, M. T. Wents the travel writer.

Still rubbing his hands together, BEN walks away from LOUIS but continues to listen.

LOUIS
Wents travels incognito: uses only cash, no credit cards. Nobody can trace his identity ... or hers. No one at the paper even knows who he or she is.

BENJAMIN
Favorable Wents review could be quite useful.

LOUIS walks up to BEN’S side.

LOUIS
Oh he’s coming, he - he’s coming, he - he’s coming.

BENJAMIN
Keep your eye on registration. I want a hourly update. Scrutinize every check.

LOUIS
Especially if they pay cash.

BEN checks his watch.

BENJAMIN
Not even 9:30 and you have already done ...

Smiling, BEN grabs LOUIS’S hand and pats it.

BENJAMIN
... a good days work.

BEN walks away and loses his smile. Elated, LOUIS raises her fists in the air.

LOUIS
Oh.

INT. BENJAMIN HORNE’S OFFICE - DAY

JEAN RENAULT leans back in a chair next to BEN’S desk. The door to the office opens. JEAN quickly stands up as BENJAMIN enters the office. BEN does not recognize JEAN. JEAN speaks with a French-Canadian accent. JEAN throws his arms out slightly.

JEAN
Mr. Horne, you look well.

BEN closes the doors to his office and throws his arms out slightly.

BENJAMIN
What can I do for you?

Behind JEAN, the fireplace is lit.

JEAN
Oh we’ve met. I sell insurance to the small business like One-Eyed Jack.

BEN remembers and points his finger at JEAN.

BENJAMIN
Jean Renault.

JEAN points his finger right back at BEN. BEN puts his hands in his coat pocket and walks up to JEAN.

BENJAMIN
What’s the occasion? Are my premiums about to be raised?

JEAN puts his hands up.

JEAN
No, no. Nothing like that.

JEAN
Sit. Sit.

JEAN gestures to BEN to have a seat where he was sitting. BEN slowly takes a seat in the chair beside his desk. JEAN has a remote control in his hand. A television monitor with a built in video cassette player sits on the desk in front of BEN. JEAN points the remote at the monitor and pushes the play button.

BENJAMIN
(whispered) You bastard.

BEN stands up, turns around towards JEAN and waves a fist.

BENJAMIN
You bastard!

JEAN raises his index finger.

JEAN
Make no mistake Mr. Horne. I’m just the messenger.

BENJAMIN
From whom?

JEAN
They request a large sum of money.

BENJAMIN
How much?

BEN looks back to the monitor.


BEN’S POV:

From BEN’S POV we FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the monitor as the tape continues to play. AUDREY struggles with a hand holding her jaw.


BACK TO SCENE:

JEAN points to himself.

JEAN
I require something else entirely?

BEN waves a finger at him.

BENJAMIN
They should bear the cost of their own middle man.

JEAN bows his head towards BEN slightly.

JEAN
Ha.

Holding his index finger up, JEAN walks towards BEN.

JEAN
Number one, your business up their is being run by pickpockets and fools. A dollar earned is a dollar stolen.

JEAN leans towards BEN.

JEAN
Are you aware of that?

BENJAMIN
I’ve my suspicions.

JEAN walks back towards the fireplace.

JEAN
What you need is a partner. Someone who can take care of these little problems.

BENJAMIN
I have a partner.

JEAN
Okay.

JEAN puts the video tape player on pause.

JEAN
You want my help or no.

BEN thinks it over.

BENJAMIN
Yes.

JEAN raises his index finger.

One more thing.

JEAN pushes the fast-forward button on the remote. BEN looks at the monitor.

JEAN stops the fast-forward motion and plays the tape. The tape plays an image of AGENT COOPER, dressed in a tuxedo, seated at a Black Jack table when he was working undercover at One-Eyed Jacks.

JEAN (OFF SCREEN)
I want this man to bring to me the ransom.

BENJAMIN (OFF SCREEN)
This man ...


BACK TO SCENE:

BENJAMIN

JEAN
Do you want your daughter back?

BENJAMIN
Of course I want my daughter back but I can’t ...

JEAN
Ssshhhhh.

JEAN walks towards BEN.

JEAN
Cash; partner; FBI man.

BENJAMIN
(smiling slightly) This is supposed to be an equitable exchange.

Smiling, JEAN pats BEN’S back.

JEAN
Hmm, this could turn out well.

JEAN walks toward the doors of the office.

JEAN
Expect a call tomorrow, noon.

JEAN exits the office. In a rage, BEN grabs the chair he was sitting on and throws it down across the floor of the room. BEN paces slightly before he picks up the telephone on his desk and punches a button.

BENJAMIN
Janet, (clears his throat) find Agent Cooper for me. Its urgent.

We PAN RIGHT, HANK JENNINGS carries a tray of food with the plates covered with metal plate covers. HANK walks towards the cash register where DONNA HAYWARD is standing. DONNA sports a new hairdo.

HANK
Well you’re looking really pretty today Donna.

DONNA
Thanks.

HANK
Special occasion?

DONNA
Uh yeah. I’m having lunch today with someone I met on my route.

HANK
Ha.

HANK leans to her and stares into her eyes.

HANK
Bed pans and shut ins, who’s to meet?

DONNA
You wouldn’t understand.

DONNA picks up the tray and walks off.

HANK
Don’t spill the soup.

HANK watches DONNA walk off. NORMA can be heard in the background.

NORMA (OFF SCREEN)
Thanks Louis.

Holding an empty coffee cup, NORMA walks up to HANK. HANK turns to NORMA.

NORMA
Hey, listen to this. I just got a call from Louis at the Northern. M. T. Wents is coming to Twin Peaks.

HANK
Empty who?

NORMA
Hank, he’s the most powerful restaurant critic in this state.

HANK
Really?

NORMA
Yeah. And a good review from him and his Seattle paper could give us a lot of business. So she’s going to try to send him our way.

HANK looks away and leans on the countertop as he thinks of a plan.

HANK
What’s he look like?

NORMA moves to the side of HANK.

NORMA
Well, nobody knows. I guess its a secret ... but he’s supposed to be arriving today.

HANK
Then we still got time.

HANK opens the cash register and grabs a few bills. HANK shows NORMA the bills and snaps at them.

NORMA
(worried) Time for what Hank?

HANK walks to the kitchen and NORMA walks after him.

NORMA
Time for what Hank?

HANK grabs his black leather jacket and puts it on.

HANK
I’m going to pick up some flowers and maybe some candles and some table clothes.

HANK puts his hands on NORMA’S shoulders.

HANK
And ah ... what can we add to the menu? Some specials maybe.

NORMA
(smiling) I always wanted to try some regional dishes.

HANK gives NORMA a big kiss.

HANK
Hhhmmmmuuhhh. Babe were going to trick this place out like Christmas on the fourth of July. Oh, and I think you should give Big Ed a call.

HANK exits the island counter through the flip-up counter door.

NORMA
Why?

NORMA looses her smile.

HANK
Well ... you’re still friendly right. So maybe this Wents guy stops in for gas.

HANK becomes quite animate as he explains.

HANK
Ed could suggest the Double R to any new faces he sees.

NORMA
I’ll call him.

HANK slams his fist on a toothpick dispenser, picks up a toothpick and places it in his mouth.

HANK
Good. You do that.


HANK points to NORMA, starts to head but turns around, smiles and then heads back out. NORMA smiles again.

HAROLD extends his glass toward DONNA for a toast.

HAROLD
To Laura. In our hearts and memories locked.

HAROLD and DONNA touch glasses for toast to LAURA. HAROLD smiles at DONNA and then reaches behind himself to a book on an endtable. HAROLD grabs a small red book and shows it to DONNA.

HAROLD
Her diary. Did I tell you I had it?

DONNA shakes her head for no. A tray of food lays on the floor beside DONNA.

DONNA
Laura’s diary?

HAROLD
Uhm (nods yes). Shall I read something from it? It seems appropriate.

DONNA
Please.

HAROLD puts his glass of wine down on the floor and flips through the pages of the diary until he finds an appropriate passage to read to DONNA.

HAROLD
Ah. But still I’m afraid to tell her of my fantasies and my nightmares. Sometimes she’s good at understanding. Other times she just giggles and I don’t have the nerve to ask why things like that are funny to her.

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME (INSTRUMENT SOLO #1)

HAROLD
So I feel badly again and shut up about it for a long time. I love Donna very muc...

HAROLD stops reading to look up at DONNA, who smiles. HAROLD resumes reading.

HAROLD
But sometimes I worry that she wouldn’t be around me at all if she knew what my insides were like. Black and dark and soaked with dreams of ... big, big men in different ways they might hold me and take me into their ... control.

DONNA looks down at the floor. HAROLD stops reading and looks up to DONNA.

HAROLD
I’m sorry.

DONNA
No, don’t be. I - I was just, I mean ... I mean if - if that’s evidence shouldn’t we give that to the sheriff.

HAROLD
No. I mean, I’ve - I’ve read this from cover to cover, Donna and there’s no solutions here. Besides, she gave it to me.

DONNA
Why?

HAROLD
People come to me and tell me their stories ... about the world outside. I take their stories and place them in a larger context. A sort of living novel.

DONNA

Oh friends, ... lovers. Well maybe, someday, you will too.

LUCY
Deputy Brennan I thought you preferred the company of your MAGAZINES!

ANDY turns to COOPER.

COOPER
Maybe you better get some air.

ANDY quietly walks outside through the front double doors of the building.

MUSIC ENDS: ANDY’S THEME   7K

COOPER walks up to LUCY and, facing her, puts his hands on the edge of her shoulders.

COOPER
Lucy, I think we’re at the point were it would be healthier for everyone if you got what ever was bothering you out in the open.

COOPER drops his hands to his side.

LUCY
Andy and I used to go out.

COOPER
That much I gathered.

LUCY
For a year and a half until I started to notice things about him. They weren’t big things, they were little things.

LUCY glimpses behind COOPER.


LUCY’S POV:

From LUCY’S POV, ANDY looks inside the building through the glass of the front door to the building. Cold, ANDY has his arms folded and shivers.

LUCY (OFF SCREEN)
He never exercises, ...

Having been seen, ANDY walks off out of view from the glass doors.


BACK TO SCENE:

LUCY returns her attention to COOPER but still checks the door for ANDY.

LUCY
... he never washes his car and he doesn’t even own a sports coat!

COOPER
Uh-huh, well did you do something about this?

LUCY
Well, after I watched this TV show I decided I needed some me time during which we didn’t see each other. During which period I met ...


LUCY’S POV:

From LUCY’S POV, ANDY walks by the front door. LUCY immediately responds by raising her voice.

LUCY (OFF SCREEN)
... DICK TREMAYNE, ...


BACK TO SCENE:

LUCY returns her attention to COOPER and speaks normally.

LUCY
... Horne’s Department Store, men’s fashions. He had lots of coats and keeps himself and his car in ...


LUCY’S POV:

From LUCY’S POV, ANDY peeks inside through the glass door.

LUCY (OFF SCREEN)
... great shape.


BACK TO SCENE:

LUCY returns her attention to COOPER.

LUCY
Most of his behavior was asinine but ... at least he was different.

COOPER
Are you still seeing this ... Dick?

LUCY bows her head.

LUCY
No.

COOPER
Lucy do want to get back together with Andy?

LUCY looks outside at ANDY and then thinks it over.

LUCY
I don’t know.

COOPER
Well Lucy, can you tell me exactly what you do want?

LUCY answers with a cry in her voice.

LUCY
I don’t know.

LUCY rushes off down the hall to the right and passes SHERIFF TRUMAN. With a coffee mug in hand, TRUMAN turns to LUCY as she passes by. COOPER walks up to TRUMAN.

COOPER
Sorry Harry, I - I was trying to help.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well it was good thought but its like trying to fix those potholes over on Highway Nine. First heavy rain and whew.

TRUMAN makes a hand gesture of a slip by gliding his hand out away from his body.

COOPER
You’ve been down this road before?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Sure have.

COOPER looks at TRUMAN.

COOPER
Harry.

MUSIC: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN (0:00 - 0:17)

TRUMAN turns to COOPER. COOPER looks around to see if all is clear.

COOPER
I’ve got a dangerous situation. I’ve examined every possible angle and I believe there’s only one way to proceed. I need a favor. Strictly between us.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What’s up?

COOPER
I need one of the Bookhouse boys. Your best man. It would be better if you didn’t know why.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper, I’ve steered clear when you asked me to. Is there anything I need to know about this one?

COOPER
Absolutely not.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I’ll set it up. 9:30 at the Roadhouse.

COOPER
Thanks Harry.

COOPER walks off. TRUMAN watches COOPER leave.

Looking outside through the glass in the front doors to the building, ANDY is still outside waiting. Cold, ANDY has his arms folded and shivers. A crack of thunder can be heard in the background.

A CUSTOMER enters the diner. The CUSTOMER is a large man wearing a black cowboy hat. NORMA and HANK walk into view from opposite sides and meet in the center of our view, framing the CUSTOMER in the distant background. NORMA and HANK speak quietly to each other.

NORMA
It must be him.

HANK
Here we go.

HANK walks off to the kitchen. NORMA walks up to the CUSTOMER.

NORMA
Good evening sir, welcome to the Double R Diner.

CUSTOMER
Thanks, think I could have a booth?

NORMA
Of course, right this way.

NORMA guides the CUSTOMER to one of the booth along the right wall. The CUSTOMER takes a seat.

NORMA
We have two very delicious specials this evening ...

CUSTOMER
I’m sure you do but I’ll have a cheeseburger, medium; a coke and some fries.

NORMA
Very good.

NORMA rolls her eyes in disappointment. NORMA walks off to the kitchen. We MOVE BACK to see TOAD sitting in a booth right behind the CUSTOMER. TOAD wears a dirty napkin tucked in at the top of his shirt like a bib. TOAD licks his thumb as HANK walks up to him.

HANK
Excuse me, Toad.

TOAD
(mouth full) Hmm.

HANK
Why don’t we finish this up in the kitchen.

TOAD
(mouth full) Hmm. Mm-hmm.

HANK grabs TOAD’S plate, picks it up and walks toward the kitchen. TOAD follows HANK.

HANK
Get in the back and don’t touch anything.

NORMA places the food order tab onto the short order hanging clip for the cook. HANK walks up to NORMA.

NORMA
He only wanted a cheeseburger.

HANK peers over to the CUSTOMER then back to NORMA.

HANK
It must be some kind of food critic trick.

NORMA
You think so?

HANK
Absolutely yeah, yeah. I think ...

The CUSTOMER, with his hat and coat removed, clears his throat to get NORMA’S and HANK’S attention as he walks up to them. HANK and NORMA turn to the CUSTOMER and smile.

CUSTOMER
Bathroom?

The CUSTOMER gestures that he would like to wash his hands by rubbing his hands together.

HANK
Oh right this way sir.

HANK leads the CUSTOMER to the bathroom. NORMA smiles as she listens to HANK.

HANK
Uh we just finished painting it and uh it looks really nice. Its completely quiet. Yeah, just follow me. Oh sorry.

Behind NORMA in the background, TOAD is eating out of one of the large cooking pots.

TOAD
(barely intelligible) Hmm, good stuff.

NORMA turns around and sees TOAD eating out of the pot with a big stirring spoon.

NORMA
Toad!

NORMA rushes into the kitchen.

NORMA
Toad. Get out of my ...

With his mouth full, TOAD backs off as NORMA enters the kitchen.

TOAD
Mmm. Uhh. Nahh nahhh.

HANK walks back out into the diner. HANK looks over to the kitchen. All clear, HANK moves over to the CUSTOMER’S jacket. Using a rag, HANK pretends to be cleaning the booth as he reaches into the pocket of the jacket and takes out a wallet. HANK hides the wallet under his rag and walks away.

We FOCUS on a sign, in the shape of a soup kettle, that reads:

ASK ABOUT OUR SPECIALS

We PAN RIGHT to FOCUS on a chocolate pie under glass. We MOVE UP and look over the pie to see DONNA and MADELEINE FERGUSON sitting opposite each other at a booth. DONNA is smoking a cigarette.

MADELEINE
Thanks for coming. I ... I didn’t know ...

DONNA
Know what?

MADELEINE
I didn’t know if you were mad or not. I mean, how mad.

DONNA
I’ll survive.

MADELEINE leans forward.

MADELEINE
Donna, there’s nothing going on between me and James.

DONNA
What if there is? I mean, who said James and I couldn’t see other people? I certainly didn’t.

MADELEINE
(disbelief; smiles) Huh, are you saying you’re seeing someone else?

DONNA
Maddy I need your help.

MADELEINE shakes her head.

MADELEINE
How?

DONNA
Harold Smith has Laura’s diary.

MADELEINE
(confused) Hah, I thought the sheriff had Laura’s diary.

DONNA
Harold said that Laura kept a second diary that I didn’t know about and he’s got it.

MADELEINE looks away.

MADELEINE
God. We have to tell James about this.

DONNA
If Laura did have a secret diary and Harold’s got it, I’m going to get it with or without you. Tell that to James.

MADELEINE and DONNA uneasily stare at each other. We ZOOM OUT and FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of HANK’S face as he steps into view. HANK opens the wallet he stole and looks down.

Positioned near the ceiling, we look down at the living room. SHERIFF TRUMAN sits on the arm of a sofa chair. JOSIE enters the room directly behind him wearing a thin, black camisole covering a thin, black negligee that has a slit that runs to her upper thigh. JOSIE walks in front of TRUMAN and pulls the camisole down, revealing her bare shoulders.

JOSIE
I know I paid too much for it but I just fell in love with it. I heard the salesperson say the only reason we’re still in business is because Josie Packard buys retail.


BACK TO SCENE:

JOSIE sits on TRUMAN’S right knee. TRUMAN looks JOSIE over.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I like it.

JOSIE

JOSIE gestures to her multitude of boxes.

JOSIE
You think I got them at Cash and Carry?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Why didn’t you tell me you were going?

JOSIE
You know I had to get away, I was afraid.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I know, afraid of Ben and Catherine.

JOSIE
You know that?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
And now Catherine’s dead.

JOSIE stands up.

JOSIE
Harry? You don’t think I ...

TRUMAN holds his arms out.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I don’t know what to think. I don’t know.

JOSIE
You think I could burn the mill? That I would ruin everything of mine?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
There’s insurance money.

JOSIE puts a hand to her mouth.

JOSIE
My god. How could you. How could you think of such terrible things. You’ve hurt me so.

JOSIE clutches at her camisole and walks away. The room fills with blue light and thunder whips outside the lodge. TRUMAN walks to JOSIE. JOSIE has taken a seat on the couch by a window. TRUMAN takes a seat next to JOSIE.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I was just so worried.

JOSIE
I’m sorry.

JOSIE guides TRUMAN’S arms around her back and hugs him.

JOSIE
Hold me. Hold me. Take me.

TRUMAN lets go, moves back slightly and holds JOSIE’S face.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Josie?

JOSIE
I want you to take me.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Josie? Josie, why? Why didn’t you tell me?

JOSIE kisses TRUMAN and then guides his hands to her camisole.

JOSIE
Tear it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What?

JOSIE
Tear it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN hungrily tears JOSIE’S camisole in two from the back. TRUMAN and JOSIE embrace and kiss. JOSIE leans back on the couch. TRUMAN lies above her, kissing her. JOSIE runs her hands over TRUMAN’S back.

JOSIE
I want you. I need you.

We PAN up to the window.

JOSIE

Standing near the coffee station, LUCY takes a drink from her coffee mug and holds it close to keep warm. Lightning flashes and thunder rattles. The lights flicker and then go out but only briefly as the power return. LUCY looks up at the lights and her eye’s widen.

In the background behind LUCY, a MAN enters the building. The MAN takes off his wet cowboy hat and slaps it against his dover. The MAN is JUDGE CLINTON STERNWOOD, a tall man with short gray hair.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Hi good looking. Who do you have to grease to get some coffee around here?

LUCY walks up to STERNWOOD.

LUCY
Judge Sternwood, hello your honor.

LUCY and STERNWOOD meet in front of the reception office window.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Lucy, your a cool drink of water for road weary eyes. What’s your secret?

LUCY bows her head slightly.

LUCY
(apprehensive) I’d rather not talk about it sir.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
(understanding) Give us a hug?

LUCY smiles and gives STERNWOOD a big hug. STERNWOOD holds LUCY.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Uh, life is hard dear. Still in all, its harder in most places then in Twin Peaks.

SHERIFF TRUMAN enters the building.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Clinton. Sorry I’m late.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Oh I only just arrived.

STERNWOOD and TRUMAN shake hands.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Good to see ya’.

TRUMAN appears distant. Squinting, STERNWOOD notices.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
What's her name Harry?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(confused) What?

JUDGE STERNWOOD
You got the look of a man with filly trouble, son. If they don’t take to saddle you’ve got two options and I won’t bore you with either one of them.

TRUMAN gives STERNWOOD a discerning eye. AGENT COOPER, adjusting his suit jacket, steps out of SHERIFF TRUMAN’S office.

COOPER
Harry?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Uh Judge Sternwood, Special Agent Dale Cooper FBI.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
How are you lad?

COOPER
Your honor.

COOPER and STERNWOOD shake hands.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You two should have a lot in common.

TRUMAN gives COOPER a discerning eye as well.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Sid will bring in the court calender as soon as the Winnebago’s tanked up. (to TRUMAN) You wanna break the seal on that Irish you stashed for me.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Right this way.

TRUMAN leads the way and walks off.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Mr. Cooper, how do you find our little corner of this world?

COOPER
Heaven sir.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Well this week heaven includes arson, multiple homicides and an attempt on the life of a federal agent.

STERNWOOD follows TRUMAN.

COOPER
Well heaven is a large and interesting place sir.

COOPER walks off. LUCY walks to window of her reception office. RICHARD ‘DICK’ TREMAYNE enters the building. LUCY notices DICK and tries to rush off, hoping not to be seen.

DICK
Lucy?

LUCY stops in her tracks.

LUCY
Dick.

DICK
Lucy I haven’t slept. I can’t eat. I’ve been absolutely miserable.

DICK walks right up behind LUCY. LUCY turns around to face DICK.

LUCY
What?

DICK
I’ve been a fool, a cad the way I’ve behaved. I’m deeply, deeply ashamed.

LUCY stares into DICK’S eyes and hold her hands to her chest.

LUCY
You are?

DICK
I’ve been over it in my mind a million times and what I’ve come to is this. I have to, no I must do the right thing.

LUCY
You must?

DICK reaches into the interior pocket of his trench coat and pulls out an envelope. DICK hands the envelope to LUCY.

DICK
Its everything I could scrape together. I’m completely accurate.

LUCY opens the envelope.

LUCY
What is this?

DICK
Six hundred and fifty dollars. I called around. I’ve been told its more than adequate.

LUCY
For what?

DICK
For the ... to take care of ... you know ... the little problem.

LUCY wads the envelope and puts it in DICK’S hand.

LUCY
Richard, here’s what you’re going to do: take your money; put it back in your wallet or your pocket; turn around and walk through both sets of doors, the second one sticks sometimes; go out into the parking lot; get in your car; turn the key and NEVER EVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!

DICK opens his mouth to say something but LUCY interrupts him.

LUCY
SAY ONE MORE WORD AND I’LL SCREAM! Please, please.

DICK tries to speak again. LUCY jumps slightly and throws her hands to her mouth to muffle her nearly hysterical scream. DICK quietly exits. LUCY goes into SHERIFF TRUMAN’S office and slams the door behind herself.

LUCY (OFF SCREEN)

ANDY walks around the corner from the hallway escorting LELAND to the conference room. ANDY hears LUCY yelling in the office. ANDY stops by the door and leans toward it to try to catch what LUCY is saying but he has to move on. ANDY and LELAND walk up the hall.

Well the uh law provides a structure to guide through perilous and trying times but it requires us a submission to its procedures and higher purposes. Before we assume our respective roles, in this enduring drama, just let me say that uh ... when these frail shadows we inhabit now .. have quit the stage ... we’ll meet ... and raise a class again together ... in Valhalla.

STERNWOOD stands up and walks over to SID. COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN give each other a look - a questioning gesture dealt towards STERNWOOD and SID.

JUDGE STERNWOOD
Well gentlemen, we’ve been uh ... eight hours on the road. Sid and I are going to pile it over to the Great Northern, hook up the Winne’ and dine in the Timber Room. See ya’ in court.

JUDGE STERNWOOD leaves the room. SID closes the door behind herself as she leaves with STERNWOOD. COOPER asks TRUMAN ...

LOUIS digs into her pocket and pulls out a business card.

LOUIS
And if you would like to treat yourself to some of our outstanding local cuisine while you’re here I would recommend the Double R Diner. Ask for Norma.

LOUIS hands the card to MR. TOJAMURA.

With light only coming in through the windows from the outside, HANK opens a nearby cabinet drawer and retrieves a large metal flashlight. HANK slams the flashlight into his hand and turns it on just as a bright streak of lighting illuminates the interior. HANK quickly turns around and points the light at the face of a PERSON standing in the dark. Thunder roars and lighting brightens the interior as we FOCUS on the face of JONATHAN, who is dressed in black with a black hat and dark sunglasses.

HANK
What’s the deal?

JONATHAN removes his sunglasses. HANK holds the flashlight up high in his left hand and shines it down on JONATHAN’S face. HANK move out from the island counter and towards JONATHAN.

HANK
Do I know you?

Lighting fills the room. HANK throws a punch with his right hand. JONATHAN quickly makes a move and throws HANK over the island counter. HANK gets back up and leans on the counter.

HANK
Okay.

HANK moves out from behind the island counter and towards JONATHAN. HANK swings the metal flashlight at JONATHAN once and then twice. HANK throws another right punch but JONATHAN makes another move that sends HANK flipping over onto the floor. HANK’S feet hit a nearby table and knock down a basket full of plates and utensils that break on the floor.

HANK quickly stands back up. HANK kicks his right foot into the air towards JONATHAN, misses and then throws a right punch. JONATHAN grabs HANK’S right arm, punches him in the stomach and then throws a punch into HANK’S face that sends him flying into the air and onto his back. JONATHAN reaches down and picks up the flashlight. HANK lifts his head from the floor but does not stand up. JONATHAN flashes the light down on HANK’S face.

HANK
Listen, I think I’m just going to lay here for a while.

HANK stretches his hand out in front of his face to block the glare of the flashlight from hitting his eyes. A small trail of blood runs from the corner of his mouth.

HANK
What? What?!

JONATHAN leans down and runs his thumb over the blood at the corner of HANK’S mouth. HANK quickly jerks away and grabs at JONATHAN’S hand. JONATHAN clenches HANK’S fingers into his fingers and palm of his hand. JONATHAN and HANK’S thumbs are pressed together with blood.

JONATHAN
Blood brother, next time I take your head off.

JONATHAN lifts the flashlight up high into the air and then quickly swings down and smashes it beside HANK.
