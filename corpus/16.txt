INT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

MUSIC: CALL OF THE BLACK LODGE     272K

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, 'LOG LADY' MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us. 

LOG LADY
Food is interesting. For instance, why do we need to eat? Why are we never satisfied with just the right amount of food to maintain good health and proper energy? We always seem to want more and more. When eating too much, the proper balance is disturbed and ill health follows. Of course, eating too little food throws the balance off in the opposite direction and there is the ill health coming at us again. Balance is the key. Balance is the key to many things. Do we understand balance? The word balance has seven letters. Seven is difficult to balance, but not impossible if we are able to divide. There are, of course, the pros and cons of division.

An establish shot. We view the front of the PALMER house, with the porch light on, under a night sky. Conflicting the gentle facade of the exterior, MADELEINE FERGUSON can be heard screaming from inside the house.

MADELEINE (OFF SCREEN)
Somebody help me!

EXT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY

As the last scene FADES OUT, we FADE IN to the next scene. We view the branches of a treetop just outside the PALMER house. With birds chirping in the air, it is morning but under a gray cloudy sky. We PAN DOWN to view the front of the house.

INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY

INSERT: CLOSE-UP HOMECOMING PHOTOGRAPH

We view a CLOSE-UP on the photograph of LAURA PALMER'S homecoming queen picture. There is a TAPPING sound in the room. We slowly PAN to the LEFT to view another photograph of LAURA as a young girl and yet another of her as a very young teenager. We PAN DOWN to a sofa chair that has golf balls and golf tees scattered on it. We PAN DOWN further to the floor where a golf ball rolls by. As we PAN the floor to the RIGHT, several more golf balls are revealed clumped together near a small faux turf putting green rug. Someone in a pair of black shoes and holding a golf club is putting at the green.


BACK TO SCENE:

Standing in the living room, LELAND PALMER holds a golf club. With a ball positioned on the green, he winds up and gives the ball a pretty good whack that sends it flying into the wall and bouncing back into the room. Using the golf club, LELAND pulls a golf ball from the clump on the floor over to the putting green. Again, he winds up and hits the ball. There is a KNOCK at the front door. Still holding the golf club, LELAND moves over to the door to answer it.

LELAND opens the door to reveal DONNA HAYWARD and JAMES HURLEY. 

LELAND
Hey, Donna.

DONNA
Hi.

LELAND
James.

JAMES
Hi.

LELAND
Come on in.

LELAND walks back into the living room. DONNA and JAMES follow right behind him. 

DONNA
Uh we just came to say goodbye to Maddy.

LELAND turns to face them. 

LELAND
Oh I'm sorry you just missed her. In fact, I dropped her off at the bus station not ... twenty minutes ago.

JAMES
She's gone?

LELAND
Yes.

LELAND cocks an eyebrow at them. 

LELAND
She thought that you were coming over last night?

JAMES
Uhm, did she say anything?

LELAND
Well I would have to say that she was uh just a little bit disappointed.

Standing near a corner halfway up the stairs, SARAH PALMER, with her hair all frazzled and wearing a robe, calls out for LELAND.

SARAH
Leland?! Leland honey?!

We FOCUS back on LELAND as he politely tells DONNA and JAMES ...

LELAND
Excuse me.

LELAND walks off to tend to SARAH. Disappointed, JAMES turns to DONNA. 

MUSIC: MONTAGE FROM TWIN PEAKS: LAURA PALMER'S THEME

JAMES and DONNA look into the living room. Golf balls are scattered all about the room. JAMES and DONNA start to giggle at the sight of the odd mess. 

We FOCUS on LELAND walking back down the stairs after tending to SARAH. LELAND stops for a moment as he thinks of something and then brandishes a wicked smile before he continues to walk down the stairs.

LELAND joins DONNA and JAMES in the living room. 

LELAND
You know, if you'd like, you could write her. I'm sure she'd be glad to hear from ya'.

DONNA
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.

LELAND
Hey no bother, no bother. (smiles) Say hi to your folks for me Donna.

DONNA
Okay.

LELAND
Okay.

DONNA and JAMES head towards the door. 

JAMES
Goodbye Mr. Palmer.

LELAND
Bye James. Take it easy now.

JAMES
Alright.

LELAND closes the door behind them. He moves over to a mirror on the wall next to the door to adjust his tie. 


LELAND’S POV:

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:19)

Through LELAND’S CLOSE-UP POV on the mirror, LELAND looks at his reflection as he adjusts his tie. As he stares into the mirror his image is replaced with the image of BOB, a frightening long-haired man wearing a jean jacket. The image of BOB fades away and LELAND'S reflection in the mirror returns as he shakes his head.


BACK TO SCENE:

LELAND walks back toward the living room but SARAH shouts out to him from the second floor. 

SARAH (OFF SCREEN)
Leland?

LELAND pauses right at doorway from the foyer. He grips his golf club before him with both hands like a sword.

LELAND
Yes dear.

SARAH (OFF SCREEN)
Remember to sign us up for the Grand River Night at the Club.

LELAND
Oh, don't worry dear I won't forget.

LELAND turns around and moves back to the foyer.


BIRD’S-EYE POV:

From a view looking down inside a dark closet, we watch the door open as LELAND reaches in and grabs a long coat. He puts the coat on and then reaches down to grab a very large black golf bag. LELAND unzips the bag to reveal a bloodied clear plastic and a hand inside the bag. He stuffs his golf club inside the bag and zips it back up.

MUSIC ENDS: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:19)

LELAND carries the bag with a strap over his shoulder. Before he leaving the house, LELAND shouts to SARAH.

LELAND
Bye hon'.

SARAH replies from upstairs. 

SARAH (OFF SCREEN)
Bye Leland.

EXT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY

LELAND places his large golf bag in trunk of his car. He closes the large trunk lid of his blue convertible. Cold, he rubs his gloved hands as he walks over to the driver side door but before he steps inside he lifts his head up and exhales. LELAND whistles a tune as he steps into his car and starts it up. He unlocks two clasps that hold the convertible top down and activates a motor that folds it back. As the top folds back, LELAND backs the car out of the driveway as he hums the tune he was whistling.

INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT CELL BLOCK - DAY

Behind the bars of a jail cell in the basement of the building, BENJAMIN HORNE wipes at the dirty bars with his handkerchief. He walks over to a small and very dirty sink in the corner of the cell and whips his handkerchief at it to dust if off. Disgusted BEN mumbles ... 

BENJAMIN
God.

LELAND grabs a toothbrush, applies toothpaste to the bristles and proceeds to brush his teeth. 

Just outside the main door to the cell block, JERRY HORNE is escorted by a DEPUTY who unlocks and opens the door. 

JERRY
It smells like a toilet in here!

With a Japanese flag attached to his lapel, JERRY calls out to his brother BEN.

JERRY
Konietchwa??? Uson???.

The DEPUTY unlocks and opens the jail cell door to BEN'S cell and lets JERRY in. 

BENJAMIN
Jerry, what the hell took you so long?

BEN listens to JERRY as he brushes his teeth. 

JERRY
Oh jeez, datelines, time zones, I don't even know where I am.

JERRY looks his brother BEN over, who is unshaved and has his tie untied around his neck. 

JERRY
God you look terrible.

BEN looks himself over. 

BENJAMIN
Jerry.

BEN holds his arms out for a hug. 

JERRY
Ben.

JERRY holds his arms out and they both hug each other and pat each other on the back. 

JERRY
Well Ben, since your regular mouth piece has been charged with murder himself, I'm going to be handling your case personally. So, let's get started. Did you kill her?

BENJAMIN
Jerry, for God sakes.

JERRY takes a seat on the lower bed of the bunk bed beside him. 

JERRY
Sorry you’re right. The last thing a good defense attorney needs to know is the truth.

JERRY opens his briefcase and pulls out a pipe and lighter. BEN finishes up with brushing his teeth at the sink and cleans up. JERRY lights up his pipe.

BENJAMIN
Jerry can you get me out of here?

JERRY
They can only hold you for 24 hours without charging you. Or is it 48?

BEN shakes his head and then takes a seat next to JERRY on the bunk bed. JERRY reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a book to check the right number of hours required. 

BENJAMIN
Ohh, Jerry, Jerry I am in trouble here.

JERRY tosses the book to the ground. 

JERRY
Under control big brother.

JERRY pats his brother BEN on the back to comfort him. 

JERRY
Okay, so where are we saying you were on the night Laura died?

BENJAMIN
I was with Catherine.

JERRY
That's not a good choice.

BEN grabs a cigar out of his interior suit pocket and bites the end off. 

BENJAMIN
It happens to be the truth.

BEN goes through all of his pockets looking for a lighter. 

JERRY
Oh dear. Is there any sign of her?

BEN finds his lighter. BEN nods his head for no as he lights his cigar. 

JERRY
Bone - bone fragments or teeth?

BEN nods his head for no again as he mumbles ... 

BENJAMIN
Nah.

JERRY
(wisecrack) Charred corroborating note regarding your whereabouts?

BEN again nods his head for no as he puffs away at his cigar. 

JERRY
I'm so depressed.

JERRY stands up and walks away to the corner of the cell where the sink is positioned. JERRY turns around to BEN and, with a gleam in his eye, notices the ... 

JERRY
Bunk beds.

JERRY moves to the bunk bed and climbs to the top bunk by using the lower bunk bed as a foot ladder. JERRY lies on his side. 

JERRY
Do you remember our first room Ben? Me on the top bunk and you on the bottom bunk ... and Louise Dombrowski dancing on the hook rug with a flashlight.

BEN starts to smile as he recalls that memory.

We view a STILTED SLOW MOTION scene. Light streams in from the open doorway as LOUISE DOMBROWSKI, a young girl, steps inside the dark bedroom. Holding a flashlight, LOUSIE, wearing a skirted dress and no shoes, starts to sway and swing the flashlight around as she dances on a hook rug in the middle of the room. A young BENJAMIN HORNE sits on the floor next to the bunk bed where a young JERRY HORNE is laying, on his stomach, as they watch her dance. As the flashlight passes the faces of BEN and JERRY, who are both wearing glasses, they smile brightly as LOUSIE sways and moves to the music.

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - DAY

At the outer set of double doors to the building, LUCY MORAN opens the door for her sister GWEN who is holding her BABY, bundled in a blue blanket, in her arms. 

GWEN
You know the first time I went in they thought it was my bladder, so they checked it again.

GWEN steps in and moves aside so that LUCY can open the door to the inner set of double doors to the building. Holding a teddy bear, a plush rabbit toy, a baby bottle and carrying a bag over her shoulder, LUCY opens and holds the door so that GWEN can pass. 

GWEN
It was an infection. I hadn't even been near a rust - rusty nail.

As LUCY steps inside the building she drops the items in her arms to the floor. As her sister GWEN continues to gab away, LUCY bends down to retrieve the items she dropped and then they both walk into the building. 

GWEN
I mean, you remember that time my toe turned purple right. So instead I took a bath in baking soda and then my toe came around but I got the worst cramps like ...

As he walks out from the coffee station, LUCY asks DEPUTY TOMMY ‘THE HAWK’ HILL ... 

LUCY
Have you seen Andy?

GWEN
... I swallowed a cake whole or something.

GWEN asks HAWK a question before he can reply to LUCY. 

GWEN
Oh you must be that native person I heard so much about uhm Eagle Eye?

GWEN turns to LUCY as she guesses badly at HAWK'S name. HAWK corrects her. 

HAWK
Hawk.

HAWK asks LUCY ... 

HAWK
Sister?

LUCY
Oh yeah this is my sister Gwen. (to GWEN) This is Hawk.

GWEN and HAWK shake hands. 

GWEN
Oh, its a pleasure to meet you. God how you must hate us white people after all we've done to you.

HAWK
Some of my best friends are white people.

HAWK shrugs slightly, turns around and walks away down the hall. GWEN and LUCY walk up the hall. GWEN returns to gabbing with LUCY 

GWEN
Oh. Anyway, (to the somewhat restless BABY in her arms) oh come on, (back to LUCY) my stomach ...

INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

Looking down a hallway of the hotel, FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER and SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN walk around the left corner at the end of the hall.

We FOCUS on COOPER and TRUMAN as they walk up the hallway. COOPER talks into his mini tape recorder.

COOPER
Diane, 10:03 am, Great Northern Hotel. Sheriff Truman and I have just been with the one-armed man or what's left of him. In another time, another culture he may have been a seer, a shaolin priest. In our world he's a shoe salesman and lives among the shadows.

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

With the a CLICK, COOPER turns the recorder off.

AGENT COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN enter the lobby of the hotel.


COOPER’S POV:

MUSIC: BIG BAND

Through COOPER'S POV several people are in the room moving about but we FOCUS on LELAND, holding a golf club in his hands, as he prances and dances around the room. Dancing like Fred Astaire, LELAND hops on a sofa chair with a foot at the head of the chair and rides it down as the chair falls back. 


BACK TO SCENE:

Standing just outside the hallway they came from and wearing a puzzled look, COOPER points out ... 

COOPER
Leland Palmer.

Using his golf club like a cane, LELAND holds the club under his arm and dances backward and right in front of a BELL HOP that has his hands full with several suitcases. As the BELL HOP tries to move around LELAND, LELAND moves back and into his way.

BELL HOP
Opps, excuse me.

LELAND
Woah.

The BELL HOP finally gets around LELAND who continues to dance. A few people in the room watch LELAND as he dances. COOPER and TRUMAN walk into the lobby. 

COOPER
Does he know we arrested Ben Horne?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Doesn't look like it.

COOPER
Harry, best if he heard it from you.

LELAND glides and tosses the club from hand to hand as people walk by him. As the music comes to an end, people in the room applaud his dancing. 

MUSIC ENDS: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

LELAND continues to dance until the music stops and his last few dance steps land him right in front of SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER. 

MUSIC ENDS: BIG BAND

LELAND
(smiling) Hi Harry, Agent Cooper. Just having a little fun.

LELAND grasps his golf club vertically in his hands before him 

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Looking good Leland.

LELAND
Just call me Fred.

LELAND laughs and smiles brightly. Straight faced, TRUMAN puts a hand on LELAND'S shoulder. 

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leland, I'm sorry ... we didn't want you to hear it from anyone else. We've arrested Ben Horne for Laura's murder.

Shocked by the news LELAND loses his smile. 

LELAND
Huh?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He hasn't been charged but we're holding him.

LELAND
Ben?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's right.

Still surprised and with a skeptical chuckle LELAND asks ... 

LELAND
There must be some mistake Harry? Ben? I thought that Jacques Renault had ...

COOPER
No.

LELAND
You have a strong case against him?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yes we do.

LELAND closes his eyes, bends his head down to rest his forehead on the butt of the golf club but with his eyes still closed lifts his head back up. 

LELAND
Oh.

COOPER
Will you be alright Leland?

LELAND
Uh ... yeah. The law will handle this.

COOPER
As it should be.

LELAND opens his eyes. 

LELAND
Thanks Harry, Agent Cooper.

SHERIFF TRUMAN pats LELAND'S shoulder. LELAND walks away. SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER turn to watch him walk off. 


COOPER’S POV:

Through AGENT COOPER'S POV, LELAND, with his head bowed down, slowly walks toward the open double doors of an adjacent room. Shaken, LELAND pauses and puts a hand out to lean on the doorway before he enters the next room. By walking to his left, LELAND moves out of view. 


BACK TO SCENE:

In the room adjacent to the lobby, LELAND rests his forehead on the butt of the golf club he clutches vertically in his hands before him. LELAND grovels as he weeps in a snide fashion as he remembers the death of his daughter. 

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:15)

But with a grin, the groveling quickly turns to a wicked giggle as LELAND lifts his head and peers up. LELAND shakes his head slightly at the perverse joy in hearing that yet another person is taking the blame for LAURA'S murder. 

In the lobby, COOPER peers in the direction that LELAND walked off to.

COOPER
Harry, I'll catch up with you.

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks off. COOPER walks toward the adjacent room. 


COOPER’S POV:

Through AGENT COOPER'S POV, COOPER slowly moves toward the doorway to the next room, turns to the left and sees the back of LELAND. LELAND, standing in front of a red curtain that covers a doorway, has his head bowed down and appears to be groveling.

MUSIC ENDS: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00-0:15)

COOPER
Leland?


CLOSE ON: LELAND’S FACE

With a CLOSE-UP view of LELAND'S face, LELAND still wears a wicked grin and snickers although its mistaken by COOPER as groveling. Upon hearing COOPER, LELAND quickly loses the grin, stops snickering and lifts his head up. With fear in his eyes that he might have been caught laughing LELAND quickly replies ... 

LELAND
Yes.

COOPER
If you can remember anything unusual about Mr. Horne's behavior the night of Laura's death would you please let me know.


BACK TO SCENE:

LELAND turns to the side slightly as he answers ... 

LELAND
I will, of course.


CLOSE ON: LELAND’S FACE

LELAND returns his back to COOPER, peers up and brandishes a wicked grin. 

COOPER
Thank you.

AGENT COOPER walks away. Overjoyed, LELAND can hardly contain himself as he giggles tightlipped at the situation he is in. LELAND expresses a thought with the jump in his brow in the ways he could help AGENT COOPER. LELAND suppresses the giggle and straightens himself up. 


BACK TO SCENE:

In the mostly deserted lobby of the hotel, AGENT COOPER walks up to SHERIFF TRUMAN. 

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Everything okay?

COOPER
I'm not sure.

COOPER and TRUMAN walk off. 

MUSIC: WINDOM EARLE'S THEME

FOCUSING on the doorway to the adjacent room to the lobby, LELAND steps out from the left and peers into the lobby.


LELAND’S POV:

Through LELAND'S POV into the lobby, AGENT COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN are gone.

INSERT: CLOSE-UP PACKAGE

We view a CLOSE-UP on a white paper package as a pair of hands unfold the paper back to reveal a new pair of disposable surgical gloves. 


BACK TO SCENE:

DR. WILL HAYWARD puts the surgical gloves on and tugs on the end of the gloves, with the sound of SNAPPING rubber, to fully seat his hands in the gloves. BENJAMIN HORNE is seated at a table in the middle of the room. His brother JERRY HORNE sits beside him. AGENT COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN stand in a corner of the room facing BEN and JERRY. DR. HAYWARD grabs BEN'S index finger and holds it. 

DR. HAYWARD
This won't hurt a bit.

JERRY stands up. 

JERRY
Sheriff, I protest this brutal treatment of my client after all this man has done for this town.

DR. HAYWARD
Now hold still.

Holding BEN'S index finger with his left hand and a needle in his right hand, DR. HAYWARD quickly pokes the finger with the needle. Not aware until he feels it, BEN outbursts slightly.

BENJAMIN
Oww!

DR. HAYWARD squeezes the finger to draw some blood. Using a syringe with a long, thin plastic tube, DR. HAYWARD collects some of the blood for a test sample. As soon as DR. HAYWARD releases the finger, BEN quickly puts it in his mouth. 

DR. HAYWARD
I'll have the results in a couple of hours.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thanks doc.

DR. HAYWARD collects his things, puts them in his bag and leaves the room. JERRY leans on BEN'S shoulder.

JERRY
Gentlemen, I demand that my client either be released or charged. Never in all my years of practicing law have I witnessed such a complete and utter disregard for an accused man's constitutional rights.

With his pipe in his mouth, JERRY lifts a hand to stop COOPER and then gestures to himself. 

JERRY
Hey I'm not on trial here.

COOPER
Sit down.

JERRY takes a seat next to his brother BEN. AGENT COOPER walks toward the table and tosses LAURA'S diary on the tabletop. 

COOPER
Mr. Horne do you know what this is?

JERRY moves over to BEN'S ear and whispers ... 

JERRY
A book.

BEN answers to COOPER ... 

BENJAMIN
A book.

BEN reaches into his coat pocket, pulls out his eyeglasses and puts them on. COOPER picks the book up and flips through the pages as he holds it in front of BEN so that BEN can view its contents. 

COOPER
Take a closer look.

BENJAMIN
A diary.

BEN twiddles his thumbs and looks away as COOPER speaks. 

COOPER
We all know about One-Eyed Jacks. So did Laura. Some day I'm going to tell the world all about Ben Horne. I'm going to tell them who he really is.

MUSIC ENDS: CHERRY STEM KNOT   63K

COOPER takes a seat on the tabletop and slyly looks at BEN.

COOPER
But she never got the chance did she? Come on Ben, we're all adults here. Wild, young girl like Laura Palmer, things spin out of control. She becomes a threat, not just to you but to your business, your family.

Slightly angered, BEN points a finger at COOPER. 

BENJAMIN
You’re way out of line.

COOPER
Well maybe you don't have anything to hide. That's not what it says in here.

Irate, BEN stands up, points at COOPER and blurts out ... 

BENJAMIN
You can not ...

JERRY stands up to calm his brother. 

JERRY
Ben.

BENJAMIN

JERRY

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks over to the table. 

BENJAMIN
You can not, ...

TRUMAN puts a hand on BEN'S shoulder and pushes him down. 

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Sit down.

BENJAMIN
... understand.

Starring at TRUMAN, BEN calms down and sits back down. 

JERRY
Nice and easy, uh gentlemen I'd like a moment alone with my brother uh with my client.

BEN straightens himself up by adjusting his tie and his suit jacket.

BEN wipes perspiration from his forehead. Leaning on his brother's shoulders, JERRY moves around to the front of BEN and kneels to face him.

Sitting in the kitchen in front of a stereo tape player with a microphone plugged in, BOBBY BRIGGS, wearing a bandanna on his head and clutching a pen in his mouth, plays the contents of the microaudiocassette he found in LEO'S boot on a handheld miniature tape player. 

BENJAMIN (OFF SCREEN)
Okay, one last chance Leo. Don't disappoint me.

LEO (OFF SCREEN)
The mill?

BOBBY stops the tape and rewinds it. He depresses a button on the stereo tape player to record the audio from the microcassette using the microphone. We hear the contents on the tape as BOBBY turns the mini tape player on again. 

BENJAMIN (OFF SCREEN)
Okay, one last chance Leo. Don't disappoint me.

LEO (OFF SCREEN)
The mill?

BENJAMIN (OFF SCREEN)
Keep it simple. Insurance investigators should read arson, block letters about uh six feet high.

LEO (OFF SCREEN)
The deal as we discussed?

BOBBY stops the two tape players, grabs the pen from his mouth and writes on a note pad on top of the stereo tape player. 

BOBBY
Ben Horne ... his voice and Leo Johnson's voice.

Dumbfounded, BOBBY shakes his head at the relation between the two men. 

BOBBY
Ben and Leo?

BOBBY tears the note from the notepad, folds it up and stuffs it into an envelope. SHELLY JOHNSON calls out from the next room ...

SHELLY (OFF SCREEN)
Bobby.

BOBBY looks into the next room but doesn't see anything. He opens the tape deck on the stereo tape player, removes the tape and places it in the envelope. From the kitchen, a glass can be heard SHATTERING against the floor. 

SHELLY (OFF SCREEN)
Oh god, Bobby!

BOBBY licks the glue seal on the envelope and closes it up. Wearing a blue silk nightgown, SHELLY, splattered with pudding, walks over to BOBBY carrying a bowl of pudding. 

SHELLY
He did it again. Its your turn to clean him this time.

SHELLY puts the bowl by the sink. BOBBY tosses the unaddressed letter to the cluttered and dirty kitchen table. As BOBBY moves to kiss her neck below her jaw, SHELLY notices the letter. 

SHELLY
What's that?

BOBBY
That is our ship.

SHELLY
What's that mean?

SHELLY picks the slightly soiled letter up. BOBBY stands behind her with his hands resting on her shoulders. 

BOBBY
Since our cash cow in the other room has turned into a sink hole, I've decided to pursue a career in business.

Using a towel, SHELLY wipes some of pudding from her neck. 

SHELLY
Really, like a salesman?

BOBBY kisses her hair and then the side of her face. 

BOBBY
Uhm no, I'm thinking more executive suite.

SHELLY turns around to face him. 

SHELLY
Really?

BOBBY
Yeah.

Using his index finger, BOBBY wipes a speck of pudding from her chest and moves it to her lips. 

SHELLY
Bobby that sounds great.

SHELLY lightly and playfully bites the tip of his finger before she licks the pudding off. 

BOBBY
I'm going to give you ... anything you want.

BOBBY cradles the bottom of her head. As he touches her neck he gets some pudding on his thumb so he quickly licks it off. 

SHELLY
I want a full time nanny.

BOBBY
Maybe a French maid.

SHELLY
(scoldingly) Bobby.

She playfully slaps his right arm. They quickly and passionately kiss each other.

Surprised, NORMA smiles brightly.

NORMA
Mother.

VIVIAN
I trust those are real potatoes and not flakes?

NORMA
(nods yes) Real potatoes.

VIVIAN
(to TOAD) Excuse me.

TOAD shakes a bottle of ketchup. VIVIAN pushes TOAD'S hand holding the ketchup as she grabs a fork and helps herself to a sample of the mash potatoes on TOAD'S plate. 

NORMA
What a nice ... surprise to see you here.

VIVIAN
Hmm, hey those are good. I see they taught Henry some skill in the stockade. Where is your charming husband?

NORMA
Hank? He's not here right now.

VIVIAN quips a discerning eye. 

VIVIAN
I see.

NORMA
Mother, I got your message but if you don't mind my asking, what are you doing here?

The door to the diner chimes as ERNIE 'THE PROFESSOR' NILES steps into the diner, walks next to VIVIAN and puts his arm around her. 

VIVIAN
I want to introduce you to my new husband.

NORMA
Husband?

VIVIAN
Ernie, this is Norma.

ERNIE
Hi, how are ya'.

NORMA and ERNIE shake hands. 

VIVIAN
We're honeymooning.

Giddy, VIVIAN and ERNIE smile and chuckle. 

ERNIE
Norma I wonder if I could bother you for a cup of coffee?

NORMA walks off to fetch the cup of coffee. ERNIE tells VIVIAN ... 

ERNIE
Nice girl.

VIVIAN
She's darling.

ERNIE kisses VIVIAN on the temple and then walks aside to talk into a cellular phone. NORMA listens to her mother as she pours a cup of coffee near the coffee maker. 

VIVIAN
Ernie's a financial analysis. I just love what you've done with your diner darling. The flowers add such a measure of cheer.

Busy on the phone, ERNIE turns around and catches the last portion of VIVIAN'S sentence and mistakenly assumes it about himself. 

ERNIE
Oh thank you, thank you so much. Nice to see those good looks haven't isolated themselves to one generation.

ERNIE walks away and returns to his phone conversation. 

ERNIE
Now let's go over those figures.

NORMA
(to VIVIAN) Excuse me.

NORMA cringes slightly and walks away to the cook order window. VIVIAN follows her.

VIVIAN
You still look very smart in that uniform. Your figure's lovely it hasn't changed.

NORMA
Now I don't mean to be rude but how long will you be staying?

NORMA grabs a handful of paper napkins and a sugar dispenser. 

VIVIAN
Uhm a couple of days. Ernie wanted to see something of the country. Why?

NORMA walks back to the island counter and refills a napkin dispenser. Still on the phone, ERNIE can be seen in the background.

NORMA
I just wish I had known that's all.

VIVIAN
Oh I didn't mean for you to go into any fuss. You know me dear I'm easy. What's wrong?

NORMA
Nothing, its ... just that there's a food critic coming and ... I'm short on help that's all.

VIVIAN
Food critic, ahh. So that's why you've tried so hard to make the place look nice.

Twiddling with his phone in his right hand, ERNIE walks up to VIVIAN. 

ERNIE
Norma, hoping to spend much more time with ya'. If its alright with you Vivian we'd better check in. I've got a Tokyo fax waiting for me at the desk.

VIVIAN
We'll be at the Great Northern. I'm sorry we missed Henry. I'll call you later okay.

NORMA
Bye.

VIVIAN
Okay bye.

ERNIE
Nice to meet ya'.

With his arm cradled behind her, ERNIE and VIVIAN walk away and leave the diner. NORMA cleans the counter and picks up the newspaper ERNIE left behind. As she picks it up she notices some writing on the newspaper.

INT. ONE-ARMED MAN’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

The ‘ONE-ARMED MAN’ PHILLIP MICHAEL GERARD is sleeping seated up in a bed in a bedroom of the hotel. Suddenly, the ONE-ARMED MAN'S left nub and shoulder move wildly. Unresponsive as she blows her bubble gum, a NURSE seated at the foot of the bed looks at the ONE-ARMED MAN as his left shoulder moves. The ONE-ARMED MAN awakens in his ‘MIKE’ state and peers up into the room. 

ONE-ARMED MAN
He’s close.

The ONE-ARMED MAN politely asks the NURSE, who is now standing at the foot of the bed ... 

ONE-ARMED MAN
Could I have a glass of water please?

NURSE
Yes sir.

The NURSE walks out of the room. As she exits the hotel bedroom she passes a DEPUTY on guard, who is seated and reading a newspaper. As the NURSE walks down the hall to retrieve a glass of water, the DEPUTY stands up and checks her out. The DEPUTY tosses his newspaper to his chair and slowly walks into the open door of the hotel bedroom to check on the ONE-ARMED MAN. As the DEPUTY walks past the corner of the bathroom and to the foot of the bed, the ONE-ARMED MAN strikes a blow to the DEPUTY’S head with a mounted ornament from the nightstand. The DEPUTY quietly falls to floor. The ONE-ARMED MAN looks down on the DEPUTY.

ONE-ARMED MAN
(shamefully) I’m sorry.

We FOCUS on the DEPUTY on the floor as he rubs his head. The ONE-ARMED MAN walks around him and toward an open window.

Standing behind the island counter, NORMA slices into a pie as HANK JENNINGS walks inside the diner through the front door. HANK opens the flip-up island counter door and enters the island counter area. 

HANK
Hi Norma. I guess I'm a little late.

HANK closes the flip-up door behind himself and takes off his jacket. 

NORMA
Forty-eight hours is not late Hank, its missing.

HANK places his jacket on the counter and moves to the center cabinet shelf to grab an apron. 

HANK
I’m sorry it was some ... some business I had to take care of.

Angry, NORMA turns to berate HANK. 

NORMA
Business! No, this is business! This is a place where you come to whether you feel like it or not.

NORMA turns back around to continue cutting the pies. Working near the cook order window, VIVIAN turns to listen in on the quarrel between HANK and NORMA. 

HANK
Norma I - I ...

HANK reaches out to hold NORMA’S shoulders but she quickly turns around, pushing him away. 

NORMA
PLEASE don’t sweet talk me I’m this far away from telling you to take a hike.

NORMA indicates an inch with her hand. VIVIAN walks closer but hides behind the giant coffee maker as she listens and watches the two argue. NORMA turns back to finish the pies. 

HANK
Norma please don’t make that kind of judgment till you hear me out. Because of the bad choices I’ve made there are people out there ... people from my past who want to see me fail. I’ve tried fighting them but I just get into more trouble. I’ve tried running from them but there's always somebody faster. I know its no way for a man to live his life but sometimes its just best to hold up and wait for the storm to past.

HANK strokes NORMA’S hair and then holds her shoulders.

HANK
I didn't mean to hurt you. I'm just trying to keep my head above water.

NORMA turns around to face HANK. 

NORMA
Maybe next time you'll ask for a little help.

Relieved, HANK exhales and smiles. 

HANK
Next time I will.

VIVIAN walks out from behind the coffee maker. 

VIVIAN
Well, the prodigal son returns.

Surprised, HANK smiles. 

HANK
Vivian.

VIVIAN
Hi.

HANK walks up to VIVIAN. 

HANK
You look great.

VIVIAN
Thanks.

HANK and VIVIAN both reach out to hold hands. HANK gives her a kiss on the cheek. 

VIVIAN
Prison treat you well?

HANK
Well uh (clears throat) ... that's a long story.

VIVIAN
I'd like to hear it over dinner tonight. I have a new husband.

Again surprised, HANK smiles and turns to NORMA. NORMA walks up to HANK. 

VIVIAN
Great Northern 8:30.

HANK
We'd loved to.

NORMA
Oh - oh I - I don't think if I'll be able to get there.

HANK places an arm behind NORMA and looks at her. 

HANK
Oh we'll be fine honey.

HANK returns to VIVIAN. 

HANK

INT. SHERIFF’S TRUMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

SHERIFF TRUMAN stares out the window through a pair of binoculars.

PETE MARTELL stands in the reception area just outside the office as he peers inside through the open doorway to TRUMAN’S office. PETE looks back into the reception area and then sneaks into TRUMAN’S office. 

PETE
Harry.

Staying in his place with his gaze out the window through the binoculars, SHERIFF TRUMAN answers.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Oh hello Pete.

PETE walks up to TRUMAN.

PETE
Whatcha’ got.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Woodpecker. Pileated I think.

PETE looks out the window.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah, here.

TRUMAN hands the binoculars to PETE. PETE uses the binoculars to look outside the window.


PETE’S POV:

Through PETE’S POV in the binoculars is a CLOSE-UP view of a red hared woodpecker that is clinging to a tree. Using its long bill, the woodpecker taps at the tree.

PETE
Pileated woodpecker.


BACK TO SCENE:

PETE lowers the binoculars from his eyes but still peers out the window at the woodpecker.

PETE
Outstanding.

PETE turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN and returns the binoculars. TRUMAN uses the binoculars and looks at the woodpecker. PETE twiddles with his hat in his hands.

PETE
Harry?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah Pete.

PETE
Harry, Josie's gone.

TRUMAN briefly looks at PETE and then returns to looking at the woodpecker with the binoculars.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah I know.

PETE
I came home from the late shift. She left a note on the kitchen table, ...

TRUMAN turns to PETE.

PETE
... no explanation, no goodbyes. A note.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
She sold the mill to Ben Horne.

PETE
Well not exactly.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You don't have to explain.

TRUMAN pats PETE’S arm. TRUMAN returns to looking through the binoculars at the woodpecker.

PETE
(sniffing) I loved her.

TRUMAN lowers the binoculars and looks at PETE.

PETE
There I said it. No offense Harry.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I loved her too. I stood there and watched her go. Watched her assistant carry her bags away.

PETE gives TRUMAN a slightly puzzled look.

PETE
Her assistant?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah Asian fellow. Never saw him before.

PETE
What'd he look like?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Average height, medium build, pony tail.

PETE
Oh that was her cousin Jonathan.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
She said it was her assistant Mr. Lee.

PETE
Mr. Lee?

Befuddled and concerned, PETE gazes at the ground and then to TRUMAN.

PETE
Harry, I have a bad feeling.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I'm right there with you Pete.

AGENT COOPER, wearing his coat, bursts into the office.

COOPER

TRUMAN and COOPER walk off. ANDY enters the building and encounters LUCY holding a baby, wrapped in a blue blanket, in her arms as she waters the plants in the reception room. PETE leaves TRUMAN’S office and walks down the right corridor. 

ANDY
Lucy?

LUCY stops watering the plants and stares at ANDY'S reaction as she holds the baby. ANDY walks up to her. Stunned, ANDY believes that LUCY is holding their baby. 

ANDY

Overwhelmed, ANDY sways slightly then faints and falls straight backward to the ground.

INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT CELL BLOCK - DAY

Standing in the basement hallway, PETE peers into the cell block through the window in the door. The coast clear, he opens the unlocked door, checks back up the stairway and then enters the cell block. BENJAMIN lies in his bunk with his hand draped over his face. As PETE closes the door behind himself it CLANKS with a metallic noise. BENJAMIN hears the door close and peers through his fingers over to the door to see PETE. PETE laughs at the sight of BEN behind the bars.

BENJAMIN
Step right in Pete.

PETE moves to the cell door and rattles it as he tries to open the jail cell door.

BENJAMIN
We desperate criminals are locked safely in our cages.

PETE
I have a message for you.

BENJAMIN
Greetings from the boys down at the mill?

PETE reaches into his knapsack and pulls out a portable tape player.

BENJAMIN
Ah but first a little music.

PETE holds the tape player towards BEN and presses the play button.

CATHERINE
Hello Benjamin. Oh I’m sorry I haven’t dropped by for a visit dear but I have a strong aversion to prisons. Uhm how awful ...

BEN stands up, puts his glasses on and moves to the jail cell door. Stunned, BEN grips the bars of the jail cell door.

BENJAMIN
She's alive?

PETE laughs and then moves to his right. BEN follows him from behind the bars as he listens to the tape. 

CATHERINE
... for both of you. The night we spent together lost in love. When was that? Uhm it seems so long ago. Almost like a dream. Oh yes I remember it was the night Laura Palmer died.

Angered, BEN reaches out at PETE but PETE safely backs away. PETE moves to the left and backs away from the bars. 

CATHERINE
Memory so unreliable finally maybe it was a dream. Maybe it never happened. To tell you the truth I can't be sure anymore.

BENJAMIN
What does she want?

CATHERINE
Benjamin darling ...

BEN extends his arm to lean on the bunk bed. 

BENJAMIN
I'll pay anything. What does she want!?

PETE
You okay there Benji?

PETE chuckles. 

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

CATHERINE
In exchange for my testimony dear you will sign the mill and the Ghostwood Estates back over to me. I will consider letting you keep your precious hotel.

Crushed, BEN takes a seat on the lower bunk bed. 

CATHERINE
A representative of mine will come to you with the documents within twenty-four hours. If you won’t cooperate, well I’m confident that you’ll go on from here to excel in one or another of the many fine career opportunities offered by the federal prison system.

Enjoying the moment, PETE boldly laughs. 

CATHERINE
Ben, so nice to see you again.

PETE depresses the stop button on the tape player, hugs the tape player to his cheek and kisses it. 

PETE
Oh - ho

Seated on the lower bunk bed, BEN’S dejected feelings start to slowly turn to raging anger. 

BENJAMIN
She set me up.

PETE
That Catherine.

PETE laughs again. 

BENJAMIN
She set me up.

PETE
She’s a cautioned isn’t she.

PETE throws BEN a stern stare and then quickly opens the cell block door and leaves. BEN jumps to his jail cell door and rattles it. Enraged, BEN flings a tin cup on the sink to the ground. He grabs the mattress on the top bunk and throws it on the ground. Next, he grabs the metal frame of the bunk bed and jerks it back and forth.

BENJAMIN
She set me up.

BEN reaches down, grabs the pillows and swings them against the bars of the cell which rips them open and sends their contents of white goose feathers flying through the air.

BENJAMIN
I'll get you.

A DEPUTY peers through the window in the door to the cell block to see what all the commotion is about. Still enraged but winding down, BEN jerks the metal bunk bed frame again and then slams it against the wall. BEN moves to the toilet, slams the lid down and then takes a seat.

BENJAMIN
You set me up.

As the DEPUTY cautiously enters the cell block with feathers still floating in the air, BEN straightens himself up a bit.

BENJAMIN
Yeah you set me up.

SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER walk out of the police cruiser and over to LELAND’S convertible. LELAND gestures I don’t know what I was doing by placing his hands on his head and throwing them out. Dumbfounded, SHERIFF TRUMAN holds his arms out and smiles as he spots ... 

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leland?

LELAND
Agent Cooper, Harry I’m sorry. Are you two alright?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leland we’re fine how about you?

In the background next to the road is the country club golf course where a golfer is swing at a golf ball.

LELAND
Oh sure I’m fine, I’m fine. I was just on my way to the club ...

LELAND points to the golf course.

LELAND
... to try out a new set of irons and uh ... I must have started thinking about Ben. I guess my mind just wandered.

COOPER
Its a good idea to leave your troubles at home when operating a vehicle Leland.

LELAND nods his head for yes.

LELAND
You’re right of course. My apologies.

LELAND brightens and then points at COOPER. 

LELAND
Ah, I did remember something as you asked about the night Laura died. I was working late at the office with Ben, it was about ten o’clock. He left the room to make a phone call. I don't know who he was talking to but his voice was raised, he was angry. I heard him mention something about ... a dairy.

Mystified, TRUMAN asks ... 

SHERIFF TRUMAN
A dairy?

LELAND points at TRUMAN. 

LELAND
That’s what I think yes.

COOPER

SHERIFF TRUMAN runs over to his police cruiser to answer LUCY’S call. AGENT COOPER looks out at the golfers on the golf course. LELAND slaps the top of his side rearview mirror to get COOPER'S attention. COOPER looks down at LELAND. 

LELAND
Do you play golf Agent Cooper?

COOPER
Uh yes Leland. I enjoy its precision.

LELAND
I'd like to invite you for a round at the club some day. May I show you my new clubs?

LELAND opens his car door. LELAND hits the horn by accident as he uses the steering wheel to push himself up and out of his seat. In the background standing by the open door of his police cruiser, SHERIFF TRUMAN talks into the microphone of his police radio.

COOPER
Uh sure.

COOPER follows LELAND as he walks to the trunk of his car to open it. As LELAND lifts the trunk door, AGENT COOPER quickly spins around as SHERIFF TRUMAN shouts out to him. 

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper, they found Gerard near the water fall!


LELAND’S POV:

Through LELAND’S CLOSE-UP POV inside his trunk, LELAND opens his large black golf bag. LELAND reaches inside to pull out a golf club and walks away leaving the bag open with the hand of MADELEINE FERGUSON and some bloodied clear plastic sheeting exposed.

LELAND stands behind COOPER rather menacingly gripping a golf club in both of his hands like a sword.

COOPER

COOPER quickly waves bye and then walks away to the police cruiser.

LELAND

LUCY
Poor Andy.

HAWK briefly turns his head to the right to see ANDY sitting on the floor with an ice pack on his head. LUCY sits on the floor beside ANDY and holds the ice pack to his head. GWEN sits in a nearby chair close to ANDY. HAWK returns his gaze ahead. The ONE-ARMED MAN takes an interest in the scene in reception room.

GWEN
You know, the exact same thing happened to me when I first got pregnant.

Doing a doubletake, HAWK turns his head back at the scene to his right.

GWEN
I would be out shopping and then 'boom' pass right out in the produce section.

HAWK and the ONE-ARMED MAN walk off up a corridor of the building.

GWEN
Then come to covered in bruises and crushed fruit and strangers standing over me waiting to see if I was dead. You see people want terrible things to happen to you, I know.

Annoyed by the gabbing of GWEN, ANDY gives GWEN a slightly stern and blank look before he turns to LUCY.

ANDY
(intimately whispers) I want to talk ...

Nosey, GWEN moves in closely to hear ANDY. 

ANDY
... to you about my sperms.

GWEN
Sperms?

Interrupted, ANDY and LUCY turn to GWEN as she sits back and laughs.

GWEN
You know that is all men think about. You know, I remember when little Carl was first born and they laid him down on my breast and I look at him and I saw what kind of a tiny little creature I was dealing with and I thought, to myself I thought, my God just what the world needs another sperm come running around loose, right. Women beware.

ANDY again sternly stares at GWEN and so does LUCY. GWEN senses it.

GWEN
Well I did.

ANDY turns to LUCY again but does a doubletake of a brief stern look to GWEN.

ANDY
(intimately whispers) I had mine ...

Once again, GWEN bends down close to butt in and listen to ANDY.

ANDY
... counted twice. The first time they we’re all dead.

ANDY and LUCY turn to GWEN as she interrupts.

GWEN
Oh man, if I had a nickel every time I heard that one.

GWEN leans forward as ANDY quickly turns back to LUCY.

ANDY
(whispered) Second time ...

GWEN
What?

ANDY
... they were ...

GWEN
What?

ANDY
... jumping like - like salmon swimming upstream.

Annoyingly, GWEN sits up and comments ... 

GWEN
So of course all you could think of was spawning!

GWEN laughs. ANDY and LUCY bluntly look at GWEN.

ANDY
Shut up.

LUCY
Shut up Gwen.

Wounded, GWEN walks away.

GWEN
Gahh.

Now undisturbed, ANDY turns to LUCY and finishes.

ANDY
So when you told me that you were pregnant I didn’t think it could be me because mine were all dead supposedly at the time.

Unsure considering the impact of ANDY’S story, LUCY mumbles ...

LUCY
Uh-huh.

ANDY
But they got better. I was misinformed. I’m the father.

Confused, LUCY rests her head on the palm of her hand.

LUCY
Oh brother.

ANDY
Aren’t I?

GWEN walks nearby with her baby in her arms. LUCY and ANDY turn their heads to GWEN as they hear sounds from the baby.

GWEN
Oh yeah. Oh come here. You want to see your mean Aunt Lucy.

GWEN snickers at ANDY and LUCY.

GWEN
Oh - ho what’d you make you little snooky-bookems.

JERRY walks away from the wall and up to COOPER but speaks over his shoulder to TRUMAN.

JERRY

SHERIFF TRUMAN stands quietly and doesn’t answer. Puzzled himself, TRUMAN exchanges a questioning glance to HAWK. JERRY walks back to his brother but stops halfway as he is bothered by the stare from the ONE-ARMED MAN.

Oh great and will you tell this guy to stop staring at me like I’m a dog biscuit.

Enraged once more, BEN reaches out to TRUMAN. JERRY tries to hold BEN back.

BENJAMIN
You two bit lumberjack! You are finished in this town!

JERRY
Don’t make it worse.

BEN grabs a hold of TRUMAN’S shirt collar. TRUMAN defiantly stares down BEN as he gets jerked around slightly but TRUMAN pushes BEN off.

BENJAMIN
You’re finished.

JERRY slams BEN against the wall and finally calms him down.

JERRY
Calm down. What are you doing?

AGENT COOPER coolly walks up to TRUMAN.

COOPER
Harry, will you come outside please.

BENJAMIN
I’m alright.

COOPER and TRUMAN walk out of the room, close the door behind themselves and stand slightly away from the door.

COOPER
Harry, I think we’re saddling the horse before we’re ready to ride.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I don’t follow.

COOPER
I don’t think Ben Horne killed Laura Palmer.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What?

COOPER
You should release him.

TRUMAN rests his left hand on COOPER’S shoulder and animatedly moves his right hand as he speaks.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper? I’ve backed you every step of the way but I’ve had enough of the mumbo-jumbo. I’ve had enough of the dreams, the visions, the dwarfs, the giants, Tibet and the rest of the hocus-pocus.

TRUMAN points at the interrogation room door.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Now we’ve got hard evidence against Ben Horne and its my job to lock him up.

COOPER
You’re right Harry. This is your back yard sometimes an outsider can forget that.

COOPER walks away down the hall leaving TRUMAN behind. SHERIFF TRUMAN ponders if he made the right decision.

EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - NIGHT

An establish shot. We view a distant shot of the hotel under a darkening sky as the last remnants of the glowing sunset remain. Crickets chirp in the background.

INT. TIMBER ROOM - NIGHT


VIVIAN’S POV:

Through VIVIAN’S CLOSE-UP POV of her plate of food, VIVIAN nudges a portion of fish around on her plate with a fork.

VIVIAN
Well the salmon was fresh and firm ...


BACK TO SCENE:

MUSIC: DINNER MUSIC

Seated at a table in the dining area of the hotel, VIVIAN inspects the fish as she pushes it around on her plate. 

VIVIAN
... and uh just a little bit overdone.

Sitting across from VIVIAN, ERNIE adds his disappointment of the meal. 

ERNIE
Mine too.

With his napkin tucked into the top of his shirt and using both hands as he smacks away at his barbecue ribs, HANK offers his own comment. 

HANK
Just right.

Slightly embarrassed by HANK, NORMA looks away and then stands up.

NORMA
Would you excuse me for a minute please?

VIVIAN
I’ll join you.

VIVIAN quickly follows NORMA. ERNIE stands up politely as they leave. 

ERNIE
Lady’s hurry back.

With his hands covered in barbecue sauce, HANK slowly rises in turn. ERNIE stares at HANK. HANK smiles and pats ERNIE on the shoulder. Without looking, ERNIE wipes his shoulder with his napkin. They both sit back down. ERNIE leans over to HANK.

ERNIE
You’re not going to say anything are ya’? If Vivian ever found out that I had been inside she’d uh ... she’d dropped me flat.

HANK
I like your new hair color.

They both smile at each other. 

HANK
Ernie Niles. Ernie ‘the Professor’ Niles.

HANK licks his fingers on his right hand, wipes them on his napkin and then shakes hands with ERNIE. HANK wears a double four domino on his bolo tie.

ERNIE
So when did you ..?

HANK
Couple weeks ago. Let me tell you Ern, without you in there to pal around with, the last six months were sheer hell. (jokingly) Nobody to go to the library with. Nobody to stamp out license plates with. So uh, what’s your angle here with uh miss moneybags?

ERNIE
No angle.

HANK
Hey come on buddy you don’t have any secrets. Vivian’s rolling in dough.

ERNIE
I met Vivian at a Republican fund raiser. We’re married.

HANK
You must have told her some tall tales, a whopper.

ERNIE
I’m trying very hard to tell nothing but the truth these days. Its uh ... therapeutic. And uh Vivian wants me to handle all her investments.

HANK
Whew, what about yours? Interested in being a loan shark.

ERNIE
I’m out of it, I’m out of it Hank. I’m not gambling any more. I go to meetings. I go to church too.

HANK
So, what happens when Vivian finds out that you ran off with the congregations picnic fund? Ha - ha.

ERNIE
I never stole from a church, it was a savings and loan. I was sick, it was endless you know. I paid my debt. Its a new life, a clean ...

ERNIE nervously checks over his right shoulder to see if the ladies are on their way back.

ERNIE
... clean slate.

HANK
So she really doesn’t know?

ERNIE
No.

HANK removes his napkin from his shirt, wipes his mouth and places the napkin on the table.

HANK
Ernie this is interesting to me because family is the most important thing in the world to me. One must be prepared to pay any price ... to protect it. Don’t you agree?

ERNIE slyly looks at HANK.

ERNIE
Oh yeah - yeah, right, completely agree.

HANK and ERNIE notice the doors to the Timber Room swing open as VIVIAN and NORMA make their way back.

HANK
We’ll talk more later Ernie. I always enjoy our talks in the yard, man-to-man, prisoner-to-prisoner.

HANK and ERNIE politely stand back up as VIVIAN and NORMA return to the table to take a seat.

VIVIAN
We’re back.

ERNIE
Ladies.

Everybody takes a seat at the table except HANK, who picks up his mug of beer.

HANK
I would like to propose a toast to the newlyweds and their happiness.

VIVIAN
Thank you Henry. Its very generous.

HANK
To Ernie and Vivian ... to much success in their future and all their future dealings.

VIVIAN
How sweet.

ERNIE
That’s sweet.

ERNIE, VIVIAN and NORMA pick up their wine glasses and toast them together with HANK’S beer mug. They all then drink from their glasses except for HANK, who slams down his beer as he stands alone. Finished, HANK sits down, wipes his mouth with his napkin and lets out a small burp. ERNIE shakes his head slightly at HANK’S crudeness.

Suspicious that something is up between the two, NORMA stares at HANK, moves her gaze over to ERNIE and then back to HANK.

CUT TO:

INT. DALE COOPER’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

We FOCUS on the colorful window curtain near the floor as it sways slightly in the breeze from the open window. We PAN UP to the bedside cabinet where a slice of cherry pie, a glass of milk, COOPER’S mini tape recorder, a lamp and a telephone reside. COOPER reaches over and picks up his mini tape recorder. Wearing only pants and the bandage around his ribs, COOPER moves the recorder to his mouth and clicks it on to record.

COOPER
Diane, its 11:05 pm, I'm in the room at the Great Northern Hotel. There's not a star in the sky tonight. Ben Horne is in custody. The trail narrows Diane. I'm very close but the last few steps are always the darkest and most difficult.

COOPER is interrupted by a KNOCK at the door. He shuts the mini tape recorder off and puts it back on the bedside cabinet. He stands up slowly, grabs a shirt and puts the shirt on as he walks towards the door. COOPER grabs his gun holster off the top of a dresser near the door and draws the revolver. He opens the door to reveal AUDREY HORNE, standing with her hands behind her back.

AUDREY
Hi.

COOPER
Audrey?

AUDREY
Can I come in and talk?

COOPER
Alright.

AUDREY notices the bandage around COOPER’S abdomen through his open shirt.

AUDREY
Ahh is that where you got shot?

COOPER
Yeah.

COOPER puts his gun back in its holster.

AUDREY
Did you arrest him?

COOPER
Yeah.

COOPER walks into the room and turns to face AUDREY as he buttons his shirt.

MUSIC: MYSTERIES OF LOVE

AUDREY
Did he do it?

COOPER
That’s for a court to decide.

AUDREY
What do you think?

COOPER
What I think doesn’t really matter right now.

AUDREY leans against a wall of the bedroom.

AUDREY
Did you arrest him because of what I said?

COOPER
Only in part.

AUDREY
But it helped?

COOPER
Yeah.

AUDREY
All I really wanted was for him to love me.

COOPER
I’m sure that he does.

AUDREY
He’s ashamed of me.

COOPER
No he’s not.

AUDREY climbs onto the bed and sits in the middle facing COOPER. Standing at the foot of the bed, COOPER bends over towards AUDREY.

AUDREY
Agent Cooper, when I was in One-Eyed Jacks I never, never let anyone ...

COOPER
Audrey, you don’t have to say anything.

AUDREY
I want you to know ...

COOPER
I know.

They stare at each other. The telephone RINGS. A distance apart from each other, they continue to stare at each other as the telephone RINGS again. 

COOPER
I have to get that.

AUDREY
Okay.

MUSIC ENDS: MYSTERIES OF LOVE

AUDREY turns and kneels to face COOPER as he moves to answer the phone at the bedside stand. 

MUSIC: NIGHT LIFE IN TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 0:15)

COOPER
Cooper here. (reply)

COOPER turns away from AUDREY.

COOPER
How long ago? (reply) I’m on my way.

COOPER hangs the phone up and grabs his mini tape recorder.

AUDREY
What’s wrong?

COOPER
Audrey I want you to go to your room and lock the door.

COOPER bends over the bed towards AUDREY.

AUDREY
Why?

COOPER
No questions, do as I say.

AUDREY
Alright.

AUDREY quickly gets off the bed. AGENT COOPER grabs his gun holster and his coat and follows AUDREY out the door.

SHERIFF TRUMAN steps out of his police cruiser. As TRUMAN walks forward he is met by AGENT COOPER. Using a flashlight, TRUMAN and COOPER walk through the foggy woods as they descend to the river. A DEPUTY runs by them in the opposite direction.

MUSIC: WINDOM EARL’S THEME

Reaching the river, several DEPUTIES work around the scene looking for evidence. Three DEPUTIES help to pull a body wrapped in plastic out of the river where it was lodged into a pile of tree debris. The three DEPUTIES move the body wrapped in plastic to a clearing by the riverside.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Its Maddy Ferguson.

COOPER stares at the face of MADELEINE and then lifts his gaze up as he contemplates the scene.
